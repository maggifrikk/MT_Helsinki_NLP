5 Overall structure
Where 0x is indicated in the text, a hexadecimal system is used, and if 0x is not used a decimal system is used.
In the appendix, a hexadecimal system is used for expressions of codes and a decimal system is used for expressions of other numbers.
A single bytes section uses a coding structure of GB/T 11383 I 1989 to use 0x00~0x7F.
The binary part uses two eight-digit binary strings for a character with the first byte code from 0x81 to 0xFE and the last byte code from 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte part is based on GB/T11383 I 1989 0x30 I 0x39 as an expanded double-bit code with a code range of 0x8130130I 0xFE39FE39.
The first word for the four byte character is 0x81 I 0xFE; the second word code is 0x30 I 0x39; the third byte code is 0x81 I 0xFE; the fourth word market code is 0x30 I 0x39, i. e. 0x8130301 I 0x813008139; 0x8130230301 I 0x8130FFE30 I 0x8130FE39; 0x8130FE39; 0x8113130 I 0x8113139; Oo2doulag0c “0URo 230061393 0xFE39FE30 1 0xFE39FE39FE399.

Description (DESCRIPTION) C and C++ compilers are integrated. They all use one or more of the four steps to input files: pre-processing, Hiii, (assembly) MERE (linking).
The language of the source name identification file, but for the compiler, the snippet controls default settings:
gcc considers the pre-processed file (.i) to be a c file and sets a c-form connection,
g++ Considers the pre-processed file (.i) to be a c++ file and sets a connection in the form of c++.
The name of the source indicates the language type and the operation at a later stage:
.cC source program; pre-processing, compilation, compilation
.CC++ source program;preprocessing, compilation, compilation
.ccC++ source program;preprocessing, compilation, compilation
. CXX C++ source program; pre-processing, compilation, compilation
.mObjective-C source;preprocessing, compilation, compilation
.i Pre-processedc documents; compile, compile
.ii. Pre-processed c++ documents; compile, compile
.s Compiling language source procedures;compiling
compile language source programs;preprocessing, compilation
.h Preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear on the command line at other later levels are passed to the connector (Linker). Usually include:
.0 Target File (Object file)
.a Archive file
The connection is always the last step unless option-cec,-s, or-E is used (or the process is blocked by a compilation error).
During the connection phase, all files corresponding to the source program.e files, 1 library files, unidentifiable filenames (including specified.o H tag files and.a library files) are passed to the connector option (OPTIONS) in the order of the command line
The option must be given separately: de'is completely different from `-d-r '.
Most `-=E: The `-W' option has two opposite formats: -fname and -fino-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only the format that is not the default option is listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, and explained in the following chapter.
Code Generation Options
General Options
Make clear that the language of the later input file is language (rather than the default selection from the file name).
This option applies to all input files in the back until the next `-x' option is found.
Close any language specification, so process the files behind the file RE AS E `-x' option according to the name of the file.
If only one part of the four phases (pre-process, compile, compile, connect), {i>gee MEF=c compiles or compiles source files, ETER. ERA ATI defaults, the GCC can use the `.o' to change source name `.ec' to end. Note that some combinations of options (e. g. `-xcpp-output-E') {igee MEF=c compiles or compile source files, ETER. ERA ATI defaults, `.ec' to replace source filenames with `.o'.ec labels. Use the -o option to select other names.
The target papers.
When compiled, stop. No compilations.
Work at different stages of the compilation process using pipes rather than temporary files, because those system compilers cannot read data from pipes, the GNU compilers do not have this problem, the compilers can accept C " dialects " : support C programs that meet ANSI criteria.
This closes down some of the incompatible ANSI Cc key characters in GNU Cc, as well as such as unix and vax, which indicate that the ANSI trigraph properties are readily available and rarely used, and that the program entrances are not necessarily main, although they have been used (translation: all the standard libraries available under host environment, main returns an int value, typical of which is almost all the programs other than the inner core. f£reesting environment does not exist, it is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the latest information on the gcc website).
For functions declared without parameters, e. g. `int foo();', treated in C style -- i. e. does not specify the number or type of parameters. (For C++ only).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means the parameter is empty.
The list of sections is deleted from here to try to support certain aspects of the traditional C compiler.
For more details, see the NUc manual, we've deleted the details, so when the content is out of date, people don't.
Except for one thing: for the c++ program (not C), the `-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned value.
He's like the fruit of the `Ethis-is-variable' option.
-Traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, it refers to the preprocessor, but does not include other effects of the `-treatmental' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allow the use of `$' characters in identifiers (identifier) (for C++ only).
You can specify that the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option clearly prohibits the use of `$'.
(GNU C++ default allows `$' in some target systems, but not all systems..)
-fenum-int-equiv allows hidden conversion of the ant type to the enumeration type (MEF c++).
Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, and vice versa.
-textnal--templates generate smaller codes for template declarations (template declaration) (c++ only) by producing only one copy where they are defined for each template function.
In order to use this option successfully, you must mark `#pragma effectadio' (definition) or `#pragma interface' (declaration) in all files using the template.
When the program is compiled with `-textnal-templates ', the template example (template inference) is all of an external type. You have to let the required example appear in the achievement document.
This can be done by typedef, and he quotes every example he needs.
Correspondingly, if default option `-fino-exteznal-templates' is used for compilation, all template examples are clearly built in.
All member functions (except construction sub-functions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered to be empty functions of the class.
This does not mean that each call to a member function will pass through an internal virtual table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that it can call a false function directly; this is when it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch does not match the type of second and third parameter of the permitted condition expression.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis--is-variable allowing this to be assigned (c++ only).
Combining user-defined free storage management mechanisms to c++ makes `this' available untimely.
Therefore, by default, the intra-class member function is invalid for this value.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation work through the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-Funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
The machines have their own default type.
Ideally, when relying on the symbolic nature of the data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz.
But many programs have been written in simple char, and there are symbols (or no symbols, depending on the target machine of the program).
This option, and its opposite, makes that program work at the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be clearly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it acts exactly like one of them.
If there is no explicit statement of `signed' or `unsigned' modifiers, these options are used to define either a symbolic domain (bitfield) or an unsigned domain.
In default, the local area has a symbol, because the basic integer type they inherited, such as the int, is a symbol number, but if the `-traditional' option is specified, the local area will always be an unsigned number.
-Fwritable-strings store string constants to writeable data segments and do not treat them specifically.
This is to accommodate some of the old programs, they calculate the string constant as a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
The effect of new coronary pneumonia on the drug market
The impact may be similar to the economic crisis of 2008
The global new coronary pneumonia epidemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has led to a near collapse of health-care services, and restrictions imposed by Governments have caused serious disruptions in the global economy.
With regard to the drug market, the impact of the epidemic is unclear and difficult to predict, but it is likely to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers may have to find new routes and methods because travel restrictions prevent them from crossing the border.
Patterns of drug use and availability may change and government response capacity may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by the new coronary pneumonia is unprecedented, but some lessons can be learned from past crises.
Following the economic crisis in 2008, a number of drug users began to search for cheaper synthetic substances, and patterns of use shifted to injecting drug use.
At the same time, Governments had reduced their drug-related budgets.
Interventions such as drug abuse prevention and related risk behaviours and drug treatment services could be severely hit if Governments responded in the same way to the current economic downturn.
In addition, the priority of interdiction operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to move.
Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected by large quantities of drugs smuggled through commercial flights in a number of countries.
The use of commercial air travel for the supply of drugs may be completely disrupted by restrictions imposed on air passengers in almost all locations, as couriers place synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine, in their backpacks or in their personal baggage.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the use of clandestine networks and mail of goods for trafficking may increase.
In the long run, economic recession and associated closures may disrupt the drug market.
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, become drug-addicted and turn to illicit drug-related activities, whether production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to build up their ranks.
As the Government's response capacity diminishes, these shifts may quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
Population growth patterns explain, in part, the expansion of the market.
Drug abuse has been increasing worldwide, both in terms of overall figures and in terms of the proportion of drug users in the world population.
The estimated number of drug users in 2009 was 210 million, or 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, while the estimated number of drug users in 2018 was 269 million, or 5.3 per cent of that population.
Over the past two decades, drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This reflects, to some extent, the difference in overall population growth over the period, with 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries, but also the relatively rapid annual growth of light population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group increased by 16 per cent in developing countries, while that of developed countries decreased by 10 per cent.
1. Urbanization as a driver of current and future drug markets
In both developed and developing countries, drug abuse is higher in urban than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug abuse is due in part to large-scale rural-to-urban migration, which currently accounts for more than half of the world's population living in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
The increase in wealth was linked to an increase in drug abuse, but the poorest of the poor bore the greatest burden of disease worldwide, and drug abuse was more prevalent in developed than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly linked to the wealthier regions of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug abuse is high among the wealthier segments of society.
However, people with lower socio-economic status have a higher rate of transition to drug abuse.
Data from a few countries show a link between harmful drug use patterns and conditions and low income.
These models appear to be less common in the wealthier segments of society.
The economic constraints caused by the global crisis of new coronary pneumonia are likely to increase the risk to the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in labour markets, such as rising unemployment, have been associated with an increase in drug abuse in the past, and the epidemic has already forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.
New coronary pneumonia or the epidemic, which will lead to further expansion of the drug market, may lead to an increase in the number of farmers or to illicit crop cultivation, either because of the reduced control capacity of national authorities or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the context of the economic crisis.
Restrictions related to new coronary pneumonia have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have led to an increase in trafficking by sea, a low risk of interception at sea and a higher number of smuggling by air or land.
There have been recent reports of cocaine consignments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but new and potentially harmful opioids are increasing the complexity of the drug market.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.
There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic markets of Member States each year.
Most of them are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small amounts of opioids.
Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioids accounted for only 2 per cent of the new psychoactive substances, but by 2018 the figure had risen to 9 per cent.
Many of the new psychoactive opioids are similar to fentanyl, and their efficacy and harm have been proven, leading to excess deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as a blend for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or as a product of counterfeit drug opioids.
There is some evidence that the injection of new psychoactive stimulants is also taking place in Europe: a study of residuals of abandoned syringes in six cities in Europe found that many syringes are exposed to new psychoactive substances that are excites.
2. The use of new psychoactive substances may become entrenched among vulnerable groups.
A single category of new psychoactive substances has almost never formed a large market.
However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two States reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoid as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals has forced drug producers to innovate and to use many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and “ecstasy” under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug producers have been looking for alternatives not only to less regulated substances, but also to chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, the so-called “specialized precursors”.
Restrictive measures aimed at halting the spread of new coronary pneumonia are likely to further squeeze drug producers dependent on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia was reported to have contributed to an increase in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States in March 2020.
The market is changing fast.
Replacement of opiates by synthetic drugs in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The market for opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appeared to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates seized by the authorities of the Russian Federation has decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people treated for opioid use has decreased significantly.
However, the stimulant market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and a variety of cathinone, including mephedrone and a-Icofyl phenylketone, are now available on the Russian drug market.
The Russian authorities reported a sharp increase in the number of clandestine laboratories seized recently to manufacture various illicit drugs, which more than doubled in two years and increased to 152 laboratories in 2018.
Growth in the methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison and other agency personnel had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
The crystallization of methamphetamine has become a major and worrying drug outside of tramadol and tramadol.
A study in 2015 further confirmed the findings that drug users indicated that cannabis was more difficult to obtain than “fentanyl forest” or methamphetamine.
Recently, several methamphetamine laboratories had been discovered by Iraqi authorities and the Board had expressed concern at the large number of imports of pseudoephedrine formulations used as precursors at the methamphetamine laboratories.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been rising steadily.
Seizures in the first half of 2019, however, amounted to 1,657 kg — a sharp increase compared with the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan in other countries also indicate a rapid increase in production in that country.
Policy changes and trends in change
Most jurisdictions that legalize non-medical use of cannabis show a trend towards increased use of cannabis
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States permitted the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of those jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although similar trends have been observed in other jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis has not been legalized.
In the first two states in the United States, Colorado and Washington, where legislation was passed, the non-medical use of cannabis by adults has increased, particularly over the past month and daily or almost daily, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, almost doubling last month.
This indicates that the increase is mainly due to frequent and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also indicate that the expansion of the legal market between 2018 and 2019 was accompanied by an increase in usage.
However, 40 per cent of cannabis users continued to rely on illicit sources for certain products in 2019.
The reason behind the fall in global seizures of cannabis herb is the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb declined to their lowest level in 20 years, owing to a decline in seizures in North America, which has fallen by 84 per cent over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period, and seizure patterns suggest that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect on domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances, which remains difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates for new psychoactive substances.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased as a result of the adoption of domestic legislation.
Drug opioids used for pain management and palliative care for vulnerable groups who face harm from the legal and illicit drug market are distributed unevenly across regions, mainly in high-income countries.
In 2018, more than 90 per cent of all drug opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
Approximately 50 per cent are in North America, 40 per cent in Europe and 2 per cent in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12 per cent of the global population.
It is estimated that while low- and middle-income countries account for 88 per cent of the global population, less than 10 per cent of drug opioids are consumed.
Barriers to access to medicinal opioids are linked to a number of factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescription practices.
Some 35.6 million people in 2018 were at greater risk of drug abuse among the poorer population.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization can increase the risk of drug abuse and increase its consequences. Research in high-income countries confirms this, and in these studies, the unfavourable socio-economic trajectory of individuals is linked not only to their situation at a given point in time but also to the risk of drug abuse.
Drug abuse disorders also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantages and further increase the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be linked to humiliating attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexually diverse groups, persons displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug abuse or have problems accessing treatment services.
According to DALY indicators, which estimate the number of years of healthy life lost as a result of disability and premature death, the impact of harmful drug use on the wider society has increased over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17 per cent.
The increase in the number of years of disability-adjusted life associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, is particularly high — reaching 40 per cent.
The complex relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to determine all causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data globally suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
However, alcohol appears to play a greater role in violence than drugs.
While drug abuse may lead to crime, in some cases this link can be attributed in part to a variety of brokering factors, such as socio-economic disadvantages and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
Large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, could be perpetrated without violence if stable criminal structures were in place.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not only on the volume of trafficking, but rather on certain changes that contribute to an unstable balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group over another.
Recent trends
Cannabis is the most commonly used substance and opioids are the most harmful.
It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most commonly used drug globally.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the risks associated with opioids are neglected because of the small number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug abuse disorders in 2017, 66 per cent were caused by such substances and 50 per cent of the 21 million years of life that were believed to have been lost to disabilities or premature deaths due to drug use.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates the public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by tramadol, and in North America by fentanyl. The two regions have little in common with economic, demographic or general patterns of drug abuse, but are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fuelled by readily available and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, has led to an increase in the over-dose of opioid deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two thirds of the 67,367 excess deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, although the figures are low.
The excess death caused by fentanyl is due in part to the unpredictable effects of fentanyl medicines on the illicit drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the market for non-medical tramadol has grown significantly.
In the region, there is an increasing use of tramadol for treatment.
Global interceptions of tramadol increased significantly in 2017, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
In 2018, however, global seizures fell to 32 tons following the adoption of a new law regulating tramadol in India.
The two crises were fuelled by simple manufacturing and low production costs, in addition to the lack of international control over tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
Both crises have been exacerbated by the availability of these substances in both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.
Increasing use of stimulants
The area of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.
Some 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine was prevalent in North America and Western Europe.
Some 27 million amphetamine-type stimulants were used in the same year, of which methamphetamine was the most commonly used amphetamine-type stimulants in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most of the indicators available, methamphetamine use has been increasing in both regions over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes replace each other, and the use of another drug decreases when the use of such a drug increases, and sometimes increases and decreases simultaneously to meet demand in the same market.
New coronary pneumonia increases the risk of injecting drug users
It is estimated that some 11.3 million people were injecting drug users in 2018 and that around 10 per cent of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.
Over 1 million people are living with HIV among injecting drug users and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 5.85 million people died as a result of drug abuse, half of them from hepatitis C, while most of the hepatitis C among injecting drug users remained untreated.
5 The shortage of opioids resulting from the new coronary pneumonia restrictions may result in users replacing more accessible substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injection or more frequent injections, more harmful patterns of use may emerge.

European Union summit on refugee policy debate, EU official: bottlenecks in the reception process - Middle New Network
The EU summit argued over refugee policy, EU officials: bottlenecks at every step of the reception process
According to Agence France Presse, on 10 February, at the latest European Union summit that day, the President of the European Commission, Von der Laing, stated that European Union leaders had agreed to adopt a stricter policy on illegal immigration, which would make it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
This is reported to be a response to the growing concern about illegal immigration in Europe, and today the core issue of the EU is the small number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be repatriated.
In accordance with the Summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to “mobilize substantial European Union funds immediately” to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the European Union and member States have been arguing on issues such as the payment of fence fees.
Von der Laing has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the associated costs.
However, diplomatic officials in some member States stated that if the EU could share the installation of cameras, observation towers and other infrastructure along external borders, this would free up national budgets and thus accelerate the construction process.
According to the European Euroactiveiv website, EU officials recognize that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, that limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities in member States are unable to prevent refugees from submitting “many” asylum applications in EU countries, and that the EU refugee reception system is in a situation of near-permanent crisis.
The European Commission estimates that the Schengen countries of the European Union received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of almost half over the previous year.
At the same time, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries over the past year.
In that context, the Summit also agreed on a “principle” whereby an EU country could repatriate illegal immigrants on the basis of a court decision of another member State.
In addition, it was reported that EU leaders had agreed “to increase the use of the concept of a secure country”, which would open the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The U.S. upgrade of the Chip Warfare has hit the global semiconductor industry - the Middle New Network
The United States “chip battle” against China has recently been highly escalating — first, with the Netherlands and Japan, under pressure from the United States, agreeing to initiate controls on the export of Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment; then, with foreign media reports, the United States Government is considering cutting off all links between American suppliers and Chinese companies and prohibiting United States suppliers from supplying any product to China; and the Biden Government is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting United States investment in sensitive Chinese science and technology.
In recent years, the United States has not stopped its campaign against China's “chip” development, with precision crushing the Chinese semiconductor supply chain and building a “de-Chinaization” semi-conductor industry chain alliance that seeks to “detach” China completely in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is the “Technology Alliance” with South Korea, or the “Quadripartite Alliance” with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or the semiconductor industrial chain with mechanisms such as the US-Japan-Indian-Indian “Quadripartite Framework”, the United States attempts to build a US-led closed supply chain cycle by introducing politicization, camping and weaponization into the semiconductor industry, thus compensating its short plate in the area of chip manufacturing and preserving its dominance in the global chip industry.
However, the “core tactics” of the United States against China are also “800 self-inflicted” by the enemy.
Recently, the Panforest Group, a leading supplier of chip manufacturing equipment in the United States, announced that it would fire 1,300 full-time employees and plan to fire 1,400 casual workers in the next two quarters, as a result of the latest ban on the export of chip manufacturing equipment.
The global light machine giant, Asma Holdings of the Netherlands, recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in semiconductor prices.
US-medium analysis, following the United States Government's aggressive pressure on China's chip and semiconductor industries, has caused many US companies to suffer, including electronic design Automated Tool developers, chip designers, crystal-crystal manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The United States, which claims to crush China's advanced semiconductor industry, has dragged the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain into the water.
The semiconductor industry, which is a high-technology and knowledge-intensive industry, has long formed a well-connected global semiconductor industry chain.
Professionals estimate that, based on a specialized division of labour, the entire production process of semiconductor products requires more than 70 crossings across national borders for a total of 100 days.
Despite the strong foundation of the semiconductor industry in the United States, manufacturing capacity, particularly advanced process processes, is weak and heavily dependent on the East Asian region.
The regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries is difficult to change, even if the United States is trying to steer the advanced chip supply chain towards a United States-led “small circle” regionalization.
The semiconductor industry chain of “de-Chinaization” of the strong “re-engineering” in the United States has hit heavily on the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are at the heart of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry requires the participation of all countries around the globe.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively with the Innovation and Competition Act 2022, the United States Competition Act, the Chips and Science Act, to harness the hegemonic power of technology in order to consolidate its technological leadership; and to “envite” its allies, to induce the manufacture of chips such as Intel, Power Station, Three Stars, etc., to go to the United States plant, in an effort to ensure America's global leadership in the area of chips.
In the short term, the United States did create problems and reap real benefits for the development of China's chip industry and related industries.
In the long run, however, the hysteria of the United States has forced China’s chip industry to continue to break through, depriving itself of a huge Chinese market, which will ultimately significantly weaken the willingness and ability of American technology firms to innovate and undermine the development of the global chip industry.
Go, Joe.
The first items of personal pension property can be sold for a minimum of 360 days.
First sale of personal pension property.
Seven products are available for each institution for a minimum of 360 days.
The personal pension property is finally online.
On 10 February, the China Finance Network published the first list of personal pension property items, and seven personal pension property items were officially sold for industrial, agricultural and postal purposes.
As a result, the “racks” of individual pension accounts have brought together four categories of personal pension savings, individual pension management, personal pension insurance, and individual pension fund collection.
The first items of personal pension property were described as all publicly funded, net-value open products, of which 5 were newly produced, 2 were saved, and the remaining 6 were all fixed-income products, with the exception of one product, which was mixed.
According to the Beijing Young News reporter, four out of five new products came from SWF, all of which were fixed-income products with minimum holding periods of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1080 days, corresponding to a comparison of performance (annual) of 3.70 per cent - 4.20 per cent, 4.10 per cent - 4.60 per cent, 4.40 per cent - 4.90 per cent, 5.25 per cent - 5.75 per cent, respectively.
One of the remaining new products, “The shortest possession of 1095 days of the wealth of the post and Hong Jin”, is also a fixed-income-type product, which began on 10 February and ended on 19 February with a second level of risk.
One of the two remaining products is the 360-day RMB property for agro-banking finance, the “Agriculture-Hungry” initiative. The investment is of a mixed nature and the risk level is three levels.
Another survival product is the “Movement of Silver and Silver Wealth for 365 days 1 day at the shortest”, the fixed-income type, which began collection on 30 December last year, became operational on 4 January of this year, with a cumulative net value of 1.0011 on 8 February.
According to the Opinion of the Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions, the financial products in which funds from individual pension funds are invested include bank finance, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public fund, etc.
The first sale of personal pension property represented a formal purchase of personal pension property by individual pension investors through the personal pension fund account.
In November last year, the Silver Insurance Supervisory Board developed the Interim Measures for the Management of Individual Pensions Operations in Commercial Banks and Finance Corporations.
The Scheme provides that participants may purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension property, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension fund products through individual pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, three departments, the Ministry of Human Welfare, the Ministry of Finance and the National Tax Administration, issued circulars clarifying that the individual pension system was being implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, and in 36 pilot cities and districts, including Hebei Shijijia, Yu An-Shun, Shanxi Jin City, etc.
By the end of 2022, the number of individual pension participants was 1954 million, the number of contributors was 6.13 million and the total amount of contributions amounted to $14.2 billion.
Previously, the participating banks had been able to build only three types of personal old-age savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension funds.
Now, when personal pension property is gathered, how should investors choose?
According to experts from the Department of Monetary Property Research and Development, there are three characteristics of old-age and personal-pension property during the pilot phase compared to other personal pension products.
The first is robustness, a more robust risk management mechanism, a more robust investment strategy and philosophy, and the independent hosting of third parties that are not parented.
The second is the long-term nature, in which the duration of old-age property during the pilot phase is five years or more, and the next step in the issuance of personal pension property, which is in principle held for a minimum period of one year, is encouraged to hold for more than three years.
Third, there is a low threshold for the purchase of products, usually at the starting point of one dollar, which is as low as 0.01 dollars, and more favourable rates such as hosting fees, administration fees, etc. of products.
Professionals point out that investors have to choose according to product characteristics and their own risk tolerance.
Individual pension savings are characterized by long-term, high interest rates and high security and are suitable for groups with low risk tolerance; individual pension insurance products are more secure and more suitable for groups that cannot afford investment risks and can accept stable returns; and individual pension property and fund-raising products are not insurable or insurable and have a certain investment risk, but the expected returns are higher for groups with a certain level of financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

The gymnasium industry should emerge from a crisis of trust - a new network.
Another big gym, Thunderstorm?
In recent days, the issue of the rights of members of well-being institutions has been a matter of concern to society.
A number of members after the Spring Festival found out that they were not operating properly in their doors, and subsequent rumours about the closure of the agency caused panic among the members and led to the intervention of the public security and social services.
Finally, the relevant officials of the institution responded with a commitment to work to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of their employees and members in order to calm the tide.
Why is the first reaction of many members “not good” when there are problems with the operation of some of the shops of individual fitness institutions, which have been closed for a while, and the consumer could have been calm and waiting for the problem to be resolved?
Behind the vagaries of the members of the fitness club is the underlying problem of the crisis of trust in the industry.
The country's traditional gyms generally follow the prepaid model, and “earning money from users” is the bottom-line logic of their development.
Cash flow through the pre-sale of membership cards, continuous opening of new shops, which appear to be re-recycling, does not allow for a stable pattern of profitability.
Negative messages from industries, such as gymnasiums, are frequently circulated, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
In terms of market prospects, the gym is, of course, a good business with a “money road”.
The gymnasium track, though up and down, is always a matter of capital interest.
Several data show that areas such as human consumption are increasing and the market is warming.
With the steady improvement in the standard of living of the population, the concept of a healthy life takes root in the health market, and there is much to be done in the fitness industry.
The better the situation, the more important the industry needs to focus on the quality of development.
However, individual agencies are blindly optimistic about the health-care market following a recovery in consumption and have just emerged from the crisis.
It is undeniable that these years have been affected by the epidemic, that a number of institutions have withdrawn, that the trade has been reshuffled, and that it is not a new opportunity for powerful businesses to selectively scale up their acquisitions and redecorate them.
However, if the growth of the fitness market is to enter a virtuous circle and move on to a smooth road, the industry will have to change its traditional model and its business strategy.
Markets and the future can be won only if the confidence and security of consumers are re-established.
What is more necessary now for the fitness industry than for the new shops to take over the market is to sank in order to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First, it is up to the service to retain the user.
The gym is a service industry that, by its very nature, adheres to a “user-oriented” approach, focusing on the needs of users and focusing on the upgrading of services.
Second, the digital transformation is needed to enhance user experience.
For example, the Internet gym model, which is now popular, allows users to make their own choices on a fee-by-pay basis and on a site-by-site basis.
At the same time, physical data, sports data are used effectively to meet social needs and complete service closures from the line to the line.
Without private education, and without a large annual card, the user's fear of a “runway” for a fitness institution has diminished and confidence has increased.
In addition, diversity should be actively explored.
Sport consumption has now moved from a single service to a landscape, and the fitness club is expected to become a new entry point for consumption, or a new profit point for consumers around such peripheral products as physical fitness supplies and gym equipment.

The price of the discount!
Redisposal of the “pay-as-you-go” in Nanjing City - China New Network
In an interview with Yanko Evening News (journalist Marubo) Janko Evening/Uchio Journalist 10, it was found that the price-fixing agreement, which had not been seen for more than a decade, had returned to Nanjing City, and that a building located in Jiangbei Xinjiang District declared that it was “payable for the difference” and that other sources of housing before the transfer were more favourable than the previous discount, and that the developers were willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are a number of terms of a “price agreement”
This building, located in the Jiangbei Xinjiang district, is called Polyjanzi Clouds, and Mr. Sun, the houseman, told the journalist that he had found a “declaration” while he was shopping last weekend.
The pictures he sent to the press showed that the developers of the building promised to change their premises from the date of the purchase and sale contract between 1 February and 28 February to the respective source if the other sources of the project had a discount greater than the previous discount on the purchase of the house (limited to the same stock, the same building, the same unit, the same property type of other unsold merchandise), and to return the difference.
According to Mr. Sun, the replacement consultant said that it was actually a “pricing agreement” designed to reassure buyers and not to worry about the development business's promotion, “it's time to cut the price if you're afraid to buy it, there's no time to go to the shop and there's no time for that.
There are also many buyers who believe that the “price agreement” is a “cardio” for home buyers, but that the conditions are not low.
Ms. Chung, who intended to buy a new house in Jiangbei, said that the “threshold” was still quite high, since the guaranteed source was first of all the same type of house and had to be in the same building, the same unit, and the buyers had very few sources of affordable housing.
There are also home buyers who believe that, because of information asymmetries, sales do not preclude the granting of additional concessions, and that it is difficult for buyers to “maintain” rights.
It remains to be seen whether the buyer can be retained.
In November of last year, journalists consulted online real estate in Nanjing to learn that the building had been licensed for a total of 252 housing units in two of the chief's buildings, with a total size of 105 square metres, 114 square metres and 129 square metres, etc., with an average of 39,843 yuan/m2 for full renovation.
However, more than two months ago, online real estate showed a total of 157 unsold sets, or 62.3 per cent, of the current stock of the building, with a total of 128 units in building 8, 113 units in total, 44 units in 124 units in building 7, and a total of 33 sets in total, or only 13 per cent.
Marketers reported that the “pricing agreement” had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract the eyes of the buyers, the river's Yellow Hill Road's building to the bottom of the pond 'Silvering Plan' was launched, which reads as follows: “The company solemnly undertakes to return the difference to the old owner if the margin of preference for the project is increased during the year”.
Subsequently, in April 2011, nine other buildings in Nanjing committed themselves to “pay for the difference”.
“The city of the building is warming, and at this time it needs a `heavy heart agent'.
Mr. Shen, a senior executive in the Nanjing real estate industry, stated that the “price agreement” was also one of the ways in which housing enterprises were marketed.
In his view, developing firms now needed more confidence than buyers, and the introduction of “price agreements” was in fact serving as a boost.
As to the ability to retain buyers, he said that it depended on the influence of multiple factors, such as regulatory policies, loan thresholds and so on, which remained to be seen at the present time.
Many data decline, Taiwan's economy has performed poorly in its opening year - the China-New Network.
On 11 February, the Xinhua Society in Taipei exported “five blacks” of its trade volume (journalist Zhao Bo, Huang Yang), the manufacturing procurement manager index (PMI) was retrenched for seven months, and the consumer price index (CPI) was again referred to as “three words”... In the recent past, the Taiwan authorities have continued to publish economic data for January 2023.
The expert analysis found that the economy of Taiwan had performed poorly in its early years and that growth pressure was high.
According to the Taiwan authorities'financial services authorities, the Taiwan region exported $31.51 billion in January this year, reducing it by 21.2 per cent a year, with negative growth for the fifth consecutive month.
Exports from all 11 major export categories declined compared to the same period last year.
Plastic rubber and its products and optical equipment suffered the sharpest decline, with 37.6 per cent and 35.7 per cent, respectively.
The export of electronic zero components decreased by 20.1 per cent annually, the largest reduction in 11 years.
Of these, integrated circuits have fallen by 18.3 per cent annually, the largest decline in 14 years.
The Chief of Statistics in this sector, Cheymena, stated that this showed a proliferation of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry, which was entering the revision phase.
Statistics show a double drop in exports and imports from the Taiwan region in January, exceeding only $2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
According to the Taiwan authorities'financial services authorities, the decline in global end demand, the adjustment of industrial stocks inhibits the willingness of manufacturers to buy and exports are unlikely to improve in the short term, and the decline in Taiwan's exports in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected.
According to the Taiwan China Economic Research Institute, the Taiwan Manufacturing Procurement Manager Index (PMI) was adjusted by season in January of this year to 40.4 per cent, a decline of 3.3 percentage points from last December and a contraction of seven months in a row.
In the system of indicators for economic monitoring, the PMI has a 50 per cent glorification line and an index of more than 50 per cent, representing an expansion of the climate and, conversely, a contraction.
Of the five PMI component indicators for Taiwan in January, new orders, production and manpower employment were tightened, supplier delivery times were reduced and stocks were tightened.
The six main industries received a full return from PMI contraction, with the sectors ranked in line with the rate of austerity as power and mechanical equipment (35.1 per cent), electronic and optical (35.2 per cent), chemical and biotechnical medicine (39.2 per cent), basic raw materials (42.4 per cent), transport (42.6 per cent) and food and textile (45.7 per cent).
With regard to prices, the Taiwan authorities' “Main Master Plan” announced that the annual rate of increase in Taiwan's CPI in January of this year was 3.04 per cent, and that it has broken again by 3 per cent since July of last year.
Of this, vegetable prices rose sharply by 28.25 per cent, reaching a 17-month high.
In the words of Cao Chi Hoong, a special member of the Master Plan, the price of the food was indeed higher than expected, excluding the spring festival factor. The average CPI in January and February of this year should be close to 2.71 per cent in December of last year. Inflationary pressure still exists and remains high.
Experts expressed pessimism when looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, combining the media reports from such islands as the joint newspaper, the Yahoo Economy and others.
Professor Wu Dae-jung of the Department of Economics of the “Central University” analysed that the export recession could cause problems in cash flows to export manufacturers and an increased risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders led to reductions in the labour costs of manufacturers, affecting the labour market and the household economy, which in turn affected consumption capacity.
According to Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved this year, demand has continued to shrink and the decline in Taiwan's exports is expected to continue into the first half of the year.
Since the economy of Taiwan is export-subsistenced and is affected by low exports, the year-round economic growth will be less positive than last year.
“Key Engines of Global Recovery” - Middle New Network
“The Chinese economy has shown great resilience in responding to the impact of the new crown epidemic.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally keen on China's future development.
During a recent interview with a journalist in this newspaper, Julio Ríos, a well-known Spanish expert on China and honorary consultant to the China Policy Watch Network, said that the current phase in the prevention and control of the epidemic in China would lead to the further release of the dynamism of economic and social development.
Rios stated that, in the face of the impact of a variety of super-expected factors, China was coping with extraordinary economic governance experiences and measures that fully demonstrated its economic resilience and management.
While China is steadfast in expanding its openness to the outside world, the internal dynamics of economic development are growing, with State-owned and private enterprises developing in tandem.
Each year, two meetings are held in China to discuss the development of a national plan and the issue of co-sponsorship, and to build consensus, cohesion and wisdom in order to add strength to China's development.
“China has achieved long-term high-speed development since reform and opening up and is now entering a high-quality phase of development.
The international community looked forward to the wisdom of China and its programme and to its development as a new opportunity for the world.
Rios stated that China is currently fully engaged in promoting science, technology and innovation, giving new impetus to economic and social development, and that “funding, talent development, and policy incentives have allowed China to remain dynamic in its new five-year plan”.
In the view of Rios, the reform of the economic system is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has taken proactive measures to stabilize the economy, taking advantage both of the advantages of a market economy and of the superiority of the socialist system.
With a view to expanding the strategic basis for domestic demand, strengthening financial support for the real economy, supporting private, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing development, sustaining innovative development, promoting employment, raising the incomes and living standards of the Chinese people and meeting the needs of the people for diversified consumption at multiple levels, China is fully implementing its new development philosophy, focusing on promoting high-quality development and building new patterns of development, which will bring additional growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the “One Way Together” initiative.
“The steady economic recovery from the epidemic is a common objective of the international community.
China's growing potential for economic development would bring more benefits to the countries of the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
Rios stated that he looked forward to building a “one-way” partnership that would continue to unleash greater dynamism by continuing to play its important role in improving the level of infrastructure in all countries and enhancing connectivity in all fields.

Henan Province regularizes the price of oral-planting medical services - the China-New Network
Seen online news: Tooth cultivation is the ideal option for many tooth-deficit patients, but it has always kept many patients at a price of tens of thousands of dollars.
Since the beginning of the year, as the growing of teeth has accelerated, the prices of growing teeth have also been raised everywhere.
From 10 February, the full process management target for single conventional dental care services in Henan province was $4,300, and the full process cost of single conventional cultivation was not higher than 97 per cent of the regulatory target.
The cultivation of teeth refers to a form of dental deficiency repair that is based on the lower structure of the implanted bone tissue and supports the fixation of upper parts of the body.
Journalists learned from the first subsidiary hospital of the University of Zhengzhou that, for example, a single conventional crop, from planting to final rehabilitation, would cost approximately $167,000.
Patients: After the new policy, the doctor told me that in my case, it's almost 8,000 grand, less than $10,000, which is almost half the savings.
On the basis of existing projects, Henan Province has also consolidated the price of 15 oral-planted medical services, such as “plant implantation fees (single)” and has consolidated the price of the provincial public health-care institutions and the payment of health-care insurance, and cancelled or adjusted the price of 20 medical services, such as dental implants.
Mr. Li Yunjie, Chief of the Pharmaceutical Prices and Tender Procurement Division of the Chengzhou City Medical Security Department: The main beneficiaries are the quadruple, one of which is health care, and the cost of health care is low; the number of hospitals is low and the number of patients increases appropriately; a market is available for suppliers; and for our patients, the cost of planting a tooth may be reduced by half or even more.
Shenzhen: Building the country's first and world-leading city, the fast-starter -- the Middle New Network
On February 11, China's new network, according to the Wei Wei Wei Weibo 10, the Department of Industry and Information Chemistry of Shenzhen City recently published the Action Plan for the Construction of the City of Shenzhen's Rapid Pioneer.
By the end of 2023, it was proposed that a high-speed, high-capacity, low-time, super-broadband network be established to achieve the goal of “two gigabytes, full-light networks, one milliseconds, whole-of-the-world” network-building and to create the country's first and world-leading very fast-track cities.
The Plan proposes to speed up the upgrading of the gigagram of light network.
By the end of 2023, the ratio of 10G PON ports reached 100 per cent and the total number of industrial parks (industrial parks) exceeded 100.

“New variables” have emerged in China's electricity industry, and how can the “contents prevail” be brought with them?
- It's a new net.
On February 11th, China's new network called "New Variables" has emerged in China's electricity industry.
He's a Chinese financial journalist, Charbin.
“We're late, but from the very beginning we realized that it's important to try to get out of millions of shops.
“Beyond 90” girls from Guangdong are now operating a twig shop to “open flowers” on-line in a down-to-the-line shop with a history of more than 30 years.
Like the old Hong Kong film, with the classic Cantonese song, the beautiful video is refreshing by opening a tremor account for @Fanfan.
At the recently held "Seek for Peer Quality Content Sharing" event, Fang was present as a representative of a high-quality creator and presented his daily creative experience and experience.
She said at the scene, "The carefully grinded video has captured a lot of online attention, and many people are interested in the food from my house, want to cook food together, and the market is opened.
It's not the same as the rest of the rest of the world.
Fong, relying on a soup video to make more people fall in love with the "old smell" and selling up to 300,000 items of groceries in a live broadcast, saved an old shop that was on the verge of collapse.
“No content, no power,” as short video and live feeders evolve, people are entering a new phase of requirements and standards for their content.
In the early stages of the development of the live feed, the live airtime often attracted users at low discounts, and the price advantage seemed to have been the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been phenomena such as Liu Xiaohong, Eastern Selection, etc., as well as a number of non-publicly known individuals and businesses in the area of vertical segmentation who have promoted long-term business efficiency by continuously building quality content that meets their brand-modified characteristics.
According to Gao Yajun, the author of the twitching star, 6.27 million creators had converted their content over the past year through the twitching electrician, whose content creation had increased by 252 per cent and their total turnover had more than doubled.
“Behind these figures, we can feel a vibrant and vibrant author's ecology.
"Ko Ah-jung says.
The Beijing Pedagogical University Platform for Dissemination Innovation and Future Media Experiments, which previously published the Eco-Health Index (ECHI) report on the content of the electric power industry, provides an analysis of the importance of the “new variables” - quality content in the current electric power industry, using the index to assess the ecological state of content in the 27 mainstream electronics platforms in the country.
According to the above-mentioned report, the consumer industry has an eco-health index of its contents, with diagonals, fast hands, treasures, lots of pieces, and the top five in Kyoto.
The report argues that while the consumer industry content ecology is a comprehensive concept that integrates electricity and content, not all content can be integrated with electricity providers, that good PGCs (professional production content) and UGCs (user original content) are quality carriers for integration with electricity providers, that the higher the value of content platforms, the greater the variety of consumption and diffusion scenarios, and that the higher the likelihood of penetration, the greater the commercial value, the higher the proportion of content production and content consumption of such suppliers that are gradually integrated and distributed in the public and private spheres.
On the spot, the report was interpreted analytically by the Chair of the China Media Economics and Management Committee, Professor of the Faculty of Journalism and Communication of the Beijing Teacher Training University.
He indicated that, in terms of content value, the current power vendor sector had moved from “consumption accessibility” to “consumption quality” with quality, professional and differentiated content being “hard currency” in the electricity vendor sector.
At the same time, content became the foundation and catcher of a new phase of electricity vendor development, and PGC content such as knowledge fees, professional knowledge, KOL (key opinion leaders) began to be marked in electricity vendor live broadcasts.
Looking ahead to the future development of the electricity industry, it is clear that the State offers two sets of recommendations.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of the content in the electronics sector from the point of view of the upgrading of the content structure, to create standards for the production and management of content and to achieve a balance between the index and the dynamics of the content eco-health system in the electronics sector.
Another is the synergy and co-creation of values from an external ecological perspective towards the healthy development of the content vendor industry and the external environment.
“More data and artificial intelligence support will be needed in the future electric power industry to generate projections of future development stability; in addition, a more regulated and healthy growth space will be provided for businesses, bringing together the value of enterprises, users, products and services in the electric power industry to create a healthy content ecology.

Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Commentator: Promotion of Chinese-style modernization is a system project — a major speech by the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping in his 20th workshop on follow-up to the Party — China New Network
Xinhua Society in Beijing February 11th: Promotion of Chinese-style modernization is a system project — 4th round of in-depth appreciation of the important speech of Xi Jinping's Chief Secretary in his 20th workshop on the implementation of the Party
Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua
“The advancement of Chinese-style modernization is a system project that needs to be integrated, systematic and holistic in order to properly address a range of important relationships between top-level design and practice exploration, strategies and strategies, integrity and innovation, efficiency and equity, dynamism and order, self-reliance and openness to the outside world.
At the beginning of the 20-year seminar on the implementation of Xi Jinping’s socialist ideas and the Party’s speciality in China during the Xi Jinping era, members, alternates and leading officials of the Central Committee, the Secretary-General of Xi has taken advantage of the rules of modernization and has made it clear in the system that a number of important relationships need to be dealt with in practice, thus providing us with scientific methodological tools to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
The promotion of Chinese-style modernization covers all areas of economic, political, cultural, social and ecological civilization, inter alia, relations with the Party to rule over the national army and internal and foreign affairs and national defence, in order to achieve systematic planning and reform and innovation, and to continue to promote it as a whole.
A top-level design requires a profound insight into the world's development dynamics, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the population, an in-depth exploration of the rules of economic and social development, and a planning and policy system that is time-sensitive, rule-based, creative, close-knit, vertically integrated and content-coordinated.
The advancement of Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory endeavour, and there are many unknown areas that need to be explored boldly in practice, in order to promote career development through reform and innovation.
The strategic issue is a fundamental one for a political party and a country.
To promote China-style modernization, the strategy should be more forward-looking and scientific in its vision of the future and lead the way; to enhance the overall nature of the strategy, with a view to resolving the major issues at stake in the Party and the State's career, which has failed or failed; and to enhance the stability of the strategy, which, once developed, must be sustained, pursued and well-performing over the long term.
The dialectics of strategies and strategies need to be scientifically captured, their principles and their flexibility integrated, flexible, responsive, ready-made and strategic-driven.
The Chinese nation is a decent and innovative nation.
The relationship between integrity and innovation must be managed in such a way as to preserve the essence and source, roots and spirits of modern Chinese style, to maintain the Chinese character, essential requirements and fundamental principles of modern Chinese style, to ensure the right direction for modern Chinese style, and to place innovation in the forefront of the national development agenda, to respond to the demands of the times, to address major theoretical and practical problems, to actively understand and adapt to change, to vigorously promote reform and innovation, to constantly shape new dynamic and dynamic advantages of development, and to fully stimulate the creation of dynamism in society as a whole.
Efficiency is an important foundation of equity, which is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
We are promoting Chinese-style modernization, both to create greater efficiency than capitalism and to preserve social equity more effectively, so that efficiency and equity can be reconciled, promoted and united.
The relationship between efficiency and equity is handled, development is constantly achieved for people, development depends on people, development results are shared by people, and the results of modernization are made more equitable for the benefit of all people.
The promotion of Chinese-style modernization requires the management of dynamic and orderly relations and the development of a dynamic and stable society.
The two major issues of development and security need to be integrated, the overall concept of national security implemented, the system of national security strengthened, the capacity to maintain national security strengthened and the security of State institutions, institutional security, ideological security and security in priority areas firmly upheld.
Both by taking greater account of security considerations into account in development, by enhancing national security through development, and by using development gains to strengthen the foundations of national security, and by creating a secure environment conducive to economic and social development, development dynamics are constantly being stimulated to achieve a healthy interaction of high-quality development and high-level security.
To promote China-style modernization, both by following its own path and by expanding the world's vision, by maintaining openness to the outside world, and by constantly expanding the breadth and depth of China-style modernization.
It is important to remain independent and self-reliant, to keep the foundations of national and national development on its own, and to keep the destiny of our development progress firmly in our hands.
There is a need to expand the high level of external openness, deepen participation in the global industrial division of labour and cooperation, use both domestic and international resources to expand the development space of modern Chinese-style development, share opportunities for development in a mutually beneficial win-win manner, and create a better future for all.
It's a long way to go.
Under the strong central leadership of the Party, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's socialist ideology, China's character in the new era, let us take control of the rules, be steadfast, be fully motivated, proactive, creative, and deal properly with a number of important relationships. We will strive to build a new socialist modern State in all its aspects and continue to open a new China-style modernity.
The Biden government blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon program this Friday (10 February).
According to the United States Department of Commerce, the five Chinese companies and one research institution helped to modernize the Chinese army, particularly aerospace projects, including submarines and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have difficulty in obtaining United States technology exports.
The list is referred to as the “entity list” and listed companies will not be able to purchase technology or goods from United States suppliers unless they obtain a special export licence from the United States Department of Commerce.

Prior to this, the White House expressed its intention to consider broader measures to “discover and deal with” China's larger surveillance activities that threaten the national security of the United States.
The balloon incident caused further tension between China and the United States, and the United States Secretary of State, Lincoln, cancelled his trip to China.
The United States shot down balloons on 4 February, and the Chinese Government made serious representations to the United States Embassy in China, criticizing the efforts and processes of the United States, which seriously hit and undermined the stability of relations between the two sides.
From the evidence available on the wreckage and information on the procurement platform of the Chinese military, the United States Government concluded that the balloon manufacturer was “directly linked to the Chinese Liberation Army” and was a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
At a press conference on Friday, China's spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mauning, stated that China had made several statements and stated its position on the incident of an unmanned Chinese civilian craft entering United States airspace by force majeure.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she added that the relevant resolution of the United States Congress was purely political manipulation and peddling.
China is strongly disaffected and firmly opposed.
The Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement of the United States Department of Commerce, Matthew Axelrod, said: “Today's action shows that we are working together to identify and prevent the use of spy balloons by China, which violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
It's not the same as the rest of the rest of the world.
Reuters reported that one of the employees of Guangzhou Skyfun Aeronautical Technology Ltd. had stated that he was not aware of the sanctions and had refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on this information.

A few days after the earthquakes in Turkey and parts of Syria, the hope of finding the survivors is diminishing, yet the five people rescued on Saturday have given the search and rescue personnel great satisfaction.
According to the Associated Press, the five-member family was successfully rescued after more than five days of siege under the rubble in the town of Nurdai, a major disaster area in Gaziantep province.
The search and rescue personnel first pulled out the mother and daughter from a pile of ruins and then found the father, who insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, there was a shout in the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmarash, a 16-year-old and a 70-year-old were also successfully rescued under harsh weather conditions.
“What day is it today?
— The 129-hour-old boy who was trapped under the rubble was taken back to the ground to ask for help from his search and rescue crew.
A man in Kahrahmanmarash held the cat he just saved.
miraculously successful rescue cases have brought a ray of hope to an already elusive search and rescue effort, but at the same time the number of victims is rising.
Currently, according to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has resulted in more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey and over 3,500 deaths in neighbouring Syria.
Although experts have indicated that people can survive more than a week after being trapped in ruins, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly elusive.
Rescue personnel are still searching for signs of life under the rubble with heat imaging.
At the same time, the focus of relief efforts has begun to shift to those survivors who are in dire need of assistance.
United Nations officials: a “100-year-old” disaster in the region
The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, stated at a press conference in Turkey that the earthquake was “the worst disaster in the region in 100 years”.
He also commended Turkey's “unusual” response in the aftermath of the disaster.
He also expressed to Reuters journalists his desire to be able to deliver relief to areas controlled by the Syrian Government and the opposition, but also said that the matter was “undefined”.
The United Nations pledged an additional $25 million in relief contributions to the population in the earthquake-affected areas of Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced the allocation of $25 million for relief in Turkey and Syria.

Some 22,000 people were killed in the disaster and some 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed.
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered a leak from the earthquake and tsunami.
The accident was classified as the most serious level 7 in the international nuclear incident hierarchy (INES).
The Fukushima nuclear accident resulted in the measurement of trace radioactive substances worldwide, including iodine-131 and caesium-137 (half-life of 30 years).
As a result, large quantities of radioisotopes were released into the Pacific Ocean.
According to United Nations statistics, at least 870,000 people are currently in urgent need of food in the affected areas of Syria and Syria.
In Syria alone, as many as 5.3 million people have lost their homes as a result of the earthquake.
The World Food Programme (WFP) called for the allocation of $77 million to provide food to victims displaced by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
Temperatures in the affected areas are currently low to zero, and many of the victims have no shelter.
The Turkish Government had distributed a large number of hot meals, tents and blankets, but those supplies still had difficulty reaching many in need.
In Syria, which had been mired in a civil war for 12 years, the earthquake had exacerbated the suffering of the population.
In the four days following the earthquake, the World Food Programme has provided food relief to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria.
The World Health Organization (WHO) sent 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma treatment and emergency surgery.

On 9 February, Xi Jinping, the Central Secretary of the Communist Party of China, the President of the State and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, wrote back to the members of the 19th group of Chinese medical teams assisting the Central African Republic, greeting them and the large number of foreign medical personnel who assisted them, and raising high expectations.
In his reply, Xi said that, in overcoming the difficulties of working life in Central Africa and serving the local population with your heart, you are both a white angel who saves death and wounds and a friendly messenger of friendship.
This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the dispatch of the Chinese Medical Aid Corps, and I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the comrades who are carrying out the medical assistance mission.
Xi said that the Chinese people love peace and cherish life, and that medical assistance outside China is a living expression.
Let us hope that you will not forget your original efforts, remember your mission, and make great efforts to promote the spirit of the Chinese medical team, which has no fear of hardship, dedication, death or injury, and great love for the good of the local people. We hope that you will do more to promote the formation of a community of human health and well-being.
Medical aid is an important part of our work outside the country.
In 1963, my country sent the first external medical support team to Algeria.
Over the past 60 years, 30,000 medical teams and 290 million patients have been sent to 76 countries and territories in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and Oceania, gaining wide recognition from the international community.
Currently, external medical teams work in 115 medical sites in 56 countries around the world, nearly half of them in remote and difficult areas.
In recent days, 11 members of the 19th Chinese medical team have written to the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping to report on learning to implement the 20 pillars of the Party and on the provision of medical services to the local population, expressing their determination to contribute to the construction of a community of human health and well-being.

On 10 February, members, alternates and leading officials of the Xi Jinping Central Committee of Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinjin Xinjin Xinjin Xinjin Xinjin Xinjin Xinjin Xi Xian and China Xian Xi Xian Xian Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi and Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi Xi
He expressed the need to follow through on the important words of the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping at the beginning of the workshop, to be more committed to the “two established” and to the “two maintained”, to strengthen his skills, to work hard, to promote modern Chinese-style efforts and to create performances that could withstand historical, practical and popular tests in the overall construction of a modern socialist State and the comprehensive promotion of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation.
During the course of the seminar, all the participants, guided by the socialist ideas of the Chinese identity of Xi Jinping's new era, carefully studied the party's 20 spirits and the important remarks of Xi Jinping's General Secretary at the opening of the workshop, engaged in an in-depth discussion and exchange, deepened their understanding of a range of major theoretical and practical issues related to modern China, and strengthened their confidence and determination to promote the great revival of the Chinese nation under the strong central leadership of the party, with Xi Jinping at its core, and increased their sense of responsibility and purpose in carrying out their duties, doing good work and ensuring a good start on the new course of the new era.
At the completion of the workshop, 10 participants took the floor and shared the learning gains.
Chai Chi stated that learning to implement the Xi Jinping new era's socialist ideology and the spirit of the Party is both a political priority for the present and for the coming period, and a long-term strategic task, which is to promote learning and implementation in keeping with the requirements of “comprehensive learning, comprehensive management and full implementation”.
A deeper understanding of the decisive importance of the “two established” is needed, as is a firm commitment to uphold the central position of Xi Jinping's General Secretary, to uphold the party's central authority and to consolidate its leadership, to constantly increase its political judgement, political awareness and political implementation, and to maintain a high degree of political consistency with the party's centre, which is centred on Comrade Xi Jinping, in its intellectual and political actions.
To try to master the mastery of the Marxist theory, to use the Party's innovative theory to arm its minds, guide its practice, promote its work, learn from it, learn from it, learn from it, learn from it and learn from it its mission.
It is necessary to implement the 20 decisions of the good party in a spirit of determination, to promote China-style modernization firmly, to lift up their sleeves and dry them, to put down their bodies as “construction leaders” and to turn the blueprints into reality one step at a time.
It is important to bear in mind that the ruling party is always on its way, that the party's self-revolution is always on its way, that it is on its way, that it is on its path, that it is on its path, and that it is on its path, that it is on its path, that it is on its own, that it is on its path, that it is on its own, that it is on its own, that it is on its own, that it is on its own, and that it is on its own, and that it is on its own, that it is on its way.
To enhance the promotion of high-quality development skills, to serve the general public and to prevent risk-mitigating practices, research and research efforts should be made to prevent and overcome formalism and bureaucracy.
Shi Tae Feng, Li Gangjie, Li Shui, Chen Wenqing, Liu Jin Guo and Wang Xiaohong attended the closing ceremony and Chen Shei presided over the closing ceremony.
Google AI chat robots, "Crying the wrong questions" evaporated the shares of the parent company for hundreds of billions of dollars.
(combined 11-day electricity)
Google's newly launched artificial smart chat robot, Bard, has been at the disadvantage of “getting the wrong questions” in his campaign for the short film, resulting in a sharp fall of 8.9 per cent on Wednesdays by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and a collapse of the $100 threshold, with a evaporation of $11 billion (approximately $476.5 billion) and $945.7 as of Friday's closing market.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as good as Microsoft, a competitor.
According to Reuters, Google released an AI chat robot Bard's advocacy short film in the social media earlier, in which someone asked Bard: “Can I tell my 9-year-olds what new discoveries about James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have been made?
In response, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first picture of planets outside the solar system.
However, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, the first picture of planets outside the solar system was taken in 2004 by the “Very Large Telescope” of the European Southern Observatory.
Reuters reported on the “Alphabet stock price collapse after Bard responded wrongly”.
On the other hand, Google noted that Bard's response “emphasizes the importance of a rigorous testing process” and combines external feedback with his own internal tests to ensure that Bard's response “has reached high standards based on quality, safety and real information”.
Singapore's tourism industry has recovered strongly, and inbound passengers have grown 19 times more than they did in 2021.
The Singapore Tourist Board recently announced that it is expected that the number of international visitors to Singapore in 2023 will reach between 12 million and 14 million, bringing about tourism gains of between $18 billion and $21 billion; that passenger arrivals and tourism revenues will return to levels of between 67 per cent and 75 per cent before the 2019 epidemic; and that a full recovery in tourism is likely to be achieved in 2024.
Singapore's tourism market was gradually reactivated and revived in 2022.
According to the latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourist Board, in 2022 the number of arrivals increased 19 times from 33.06 million in 2021 to 6.3 million, exceeding the earlier estimate of 4-6 million by the Board, and visitors have recovered to the pre-epidemic level of 33 per cent.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenues totalled NZ$ 8.96 billion and are expected to reach NZ$ 13.8 to 14.3 billion for the entire year 2022, a six-to-sevenfold increase from NZ$ 1.89 billion in 2021 and a return to the levels of about 50 to 52 per cent prior to the 2019 epidemic.
The Government of Singapore has taken a number of steps to accelerate the recovery of tourism.
In April 2022, the Government announced the allocation of nearly S$500 million to stimulate tourism recovery.
The Tourist Board has announced a plan to allocate NZ$ 110 million over the next two years from this budget to introduce more commercial and leisure activities to attract travellers back.
In order to make healthy upbringing one of Singapore's tourist attractions, the Singapore Tourist Board released a call for intent on 23 November 2022 to develop a healthy feeding site on Singapore's southern coast.
The Executive Director of Sports and Restaurant Tourism of the Singapore Tourism Authority, Ms. Lingli Wang, said that, in recent years, more and more tourists had placed their health at the top of their considerations.
The development of a healthy farm site in the southern coastal zone, which has a bay garden and a sea dam, is expected to contribute to the tourism industry and economy of Singapore, allowing tourists to consume and stay longer in Singapore.
Chen Jianlong, Director of the Singapore Tourism Authority, said that healthy upbringing would be an important component of Singapore's tourism products in the coming years.
The new crown epidemic has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourist Board has been promoting healthy feeding projects for the local public and international tourists over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Authority held its first Health and Feeding Festival, which provided the public with more than 130 health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Gulf Garden's Afanda World, the St. Louis Central Beach Market, the new “Exploring New Areas” exhibition hall at the Museum of Arts Sciences, and the new open theatre at the Night Wildlife Park, the Tourist Board will support the development and upgrading of projects such as the Bird Park of the World of All Lives, making Singapore an attractive place for international travel.
It is planned that Singapore will develop, within 2023, industry standards for conferences, exhibitions and incentives for the sustainable development of tourism, with a focus on improving both waste treatment and carbon emissions and further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery in the tourism sector in Singapore has accelerated the recovery in the aviation sector.
The data show that, as at 18 December 2022, traffic at the airport had recovered strongly, with up to 150,000 passengers per day receiving approximately 1 million passengers per week, equivalent to about 75 per cent of the pre-emerging epidemic, and aviation workers returning to their pre-epidemiological level of about 90 per cent.
According to the data, Singapore had received 23.6 million passengers between January and October 2022, equivalent to 42 per cent of the number of flights prior to the new crown and 170,000 flights, or 53 per cent of the number prior to the outbreak.
The rapid recovery in tourism has also led to a recovery in such sectors as accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping.
The Government of Singapore and the tourism industry have high expectations for the Chinese market.
The Assistant Director of International Affairs of the Singapore Tourism Authority, Ko Shodan, said that a survey of China's travel platforms showed that Singapore's security index was among the top three in the world, and that this was one of the reasons why Singapore was very popular with Chinese tourists.
Prior to the new crown epidemic, China had about 3.6 million trips to Singapore every year.
With the liberalization of China's border policy, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year will return to between 30 and 60 per cent in 2019.
Kessudan stated that the Tourist Board would then pay close attention to further signals released by China's exit travel policy in response to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with China's online travel platforms, such as couriers, and travel agencies, the Singapore Tourism Authority will be actively prepared to host Chinese tourists in response to new trends in travel outside China.
Looking ahead to the 2023 tourism market, the Singapore Tourist Board is confident that the tourism sector will recover faster than expected as long as there is no significant recession in the global economy affecting public revenues and no new major deadly outbreaks.
Kim Jong-un's father and daughter interacted with each other.
On the evening of the 8th day of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the 75th anniversary of the Military Establishment Section was observed, and Kim Jong-un's daughter Kim's love not only attended but also stood on the podium with his father.
On 9 September, the Korean media released a film in which the Kim loved to be close to his father, looked at him and whispered several times, and she held his cheeks lightly with her hands and even touched him in the chest, and the father and daughter interacted with him to the top of the country.
However, the First Lady, Lord Li Shei, could only step aside.
In a combination of Korean “Korea News” and other reports, Kim Jong-un and Lord Li Shei, in an official photo taken with their daughter Kim's love to attend dinner on 7 days, not only did Kim's love rarely sit in his parent's right-to-parent position C, but she joined Kim Jong-un on the podium at the 75th anniversary ceremony of the building of the military section the following night.
As a result of the release of the military-style video by the Korean official medium “North Korean Central Television”, more images of the love of the father and the daughter have been exposed.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium, the smiles on both faces never retreated and whispered in each other's ears, and Kim loved to hold his father's cheeks with his hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a grinning smile.
Other media images also show that King's love and Kim Jong-un were sitting on their indoor couches, touching their father's face constantly with their hands; while she and her father were walking with their hands, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hands.
First Lady Li Shei was able to walk behind or sit side by side, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
According to the Korean media, King Kim loves to show his face in public for the first time since the testing of the 17 missiles on Mars on 18 November last year. The exposure rate has increased over the past three months and is now the fifth in a formal setting.
In referring to the love of the King, the Korean media used the very high name of the beloved son, the noble son and so forth, and also aired fragments of the love of the King overlooking the march of the army, in which he vowed to die in favour of the white-headed lineage.
These signs cast doubt on whether Kim's love has been identified as the heir to the King's regime, and the Washington Post analyses that “this is Kim Jong-un's signal to put her high school-age daughter in the position of successor”, although there is also a view that such a determination is still premature and that in the case of Kim Jong-un's son on his knees, there are various possibilities.

A: On 3 February, the United States Department of Labor released non-farm employment data for January 2023, adding 517,000 new non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market forecast of 189,000; unemployment fell to 3.4 per cent, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; and hourly wages increased 4.4 per cent, and the ring increased 0.3 per cent, slightly slower.
In terms of aggregates, there are a number of one-time and technical disturbances in the data, such as the staff returning from strike work, the revision of survey statistics, the updating of the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be amended (cf. the new non-farmers from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and non-farm employment, or not as strong as the data reflect.
Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still relatively low, and there has been a significant recovery in new employment in high-contact services such as leisure hotels, education and health, and data show that labour gaps remain in the services sector.
In combination with the recovery of equally over-expected services PMI, job openings and labour gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the services sector in the United States has been rapidly repaired after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that supply and demand constraints in the United States employment market cannot be improved without a recession.
There are currently over 5 million supply gaps in the United States labour market, while labour participation rates have been slow to rise, especially in the 25-54 age group, which is close to the pre-epidemic high.
In addition, the strong demand for consumption will push the impact of austerity policies on the employment market further behind the strength of United States residents'excess savings and consumer credit.
Continued demand and supply stress in the United States employment market will be the background of the United States economy in 2023.
We are not optimistic about the continuing decline in the rate of salary increases, which are now nearing the end of the hike, and with repeated inflation expectations.
Prior to the release of the data, the United States stock exchange market was overly optimistic about the Fed's expectation of an interest increase path.
As inflation data continue to improve, the Fed continues to maintain a fragile balance of market inflation expectations while reducing the rate increase, but the market turns a blind eye to the Fed's bias towards eagles and not only anticipates an early cessation of interest increases, but also two interest reductions at the end of the year.
In the context of labour market supply and demand constraints and the uncertain impact of austerity policies, we believe that the Fed's end-of-year guidelines for interest increases are relatively reasonable and that the extreme expectations of the market for adjustment and trade congestion may be detrimental to the market.
Nevertheless, the persistence of salary increases has been difficult to reverse the current downward trend in inflation, and, as M2 data have moved upwards and the respective CPI sub-leadings have gradually improved, United States CPI data have moved to a rapid downward phase since October, and the persistence of salary increases will only provide the basis for subsequent inflation data, and current market expectations are hard to prove, with the next round of inflation data being published or entering a new round of games.
The founder, Jung Young, died of a heart attack, led the first transformation of Chinese clothing - Economic Watch - a professional financial news site.
On February 11th, the certified subject issued an obituary notice for the micro-public of the Sugib Holdings Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “the Sugib Holdings”), and Jung Yonggang, founder of the Sugia Enterprise and chairman of the Board of Directors of the Sugib Holdings, died on February 10th, 2023, and was 65 years old.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yongg was the director of the State cotton mill and, with his transfer, in 1989 Jung Yongg became the director of the former Ningpoun clothing plant of the stock of the Sugia.
In December 2022, at the twentieth annual meeting of Chinese business leaders and the twenty-second annual meeting of Chinese business futures, Jung Young-gang stated in his speech that in the 1990s, the market for Chinese suits had reached 37%.
In 1996, the stockholding (600884.SH) was listed as the first listed company in China's garment industry.
Just as the apparel business began to change in the middle of the day, Jung Yongg realized that, “When the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form a ladder-style brand market, the suit will always be exclusive, and there is little chance that it will become a national uniform for the long term.”
In 1999, when we began to study business transformation, Jung Youngg recalled that, “We came to Shanghai to find out what the transformation was and what it was doing, and we had a lot of expert scholars, and there were successive conferences, retreats, retreats and retreats.
Finally, we set two broad strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy materials, and the other is a healthy future."
Following the establishment of the strategic direction, the country began to seek cooperation, when the Institute of Charcoal, which is equipped with saddle steel, was working on the subject of the State's 863 research and research, and the Institute of Carbon, which has signed a cooperation agreement between the Institute of Cartoon, which is responsible for promoting the industrialization of the State's 863 project entitled “Middle carbon microball”, which involves the development, production and marketing of negative-polar materials and the commercial promotion of negative-polar materials in the country.
In 2001, the stock of the fir-gill was scaled up and nationalized to replace Japan as the main supplier of the meso-coal-coalin microball in the country.
This was the first Lithium ion battery in China to produce negative polar material, which was nationalized by lithium ion batteries.
With the rapid spread of lithium battery applications, the lithium cell business of the stock of the stock began to develop gradually, and in 2007 the business of lithium electric materials was incorporated into the main business of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock, with a reduction in the share of the clothing business from year to year, until 2013, when revenues from the business of lithium electric materials of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock exceeded the business of clothing.
In February 2021, the stock of the stock successfully acquired the LG chemical glimmer business, marched into the LCD glimmer market and set up a glimmer company with a relatively high level of technology in this field. The main competitors in the stock are the world's more than 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japanese alumni chemistry, and Japanese electricians.
Jung Young just shared the idea of post-investment management: “China’s private sector buys a number of high-tech international firms with a lower probability of success, why would they fail?
Because everyone would think that I spent so much money, and I had to send someone to take care of it, which is what I usually do," but Jung Yonggang, unlike Jung Youngg, on the day of his successful acquisition of the Sugi Sun, Jung Yonggang announced in public that, as a major shareholder of the Sugi stock, he had decided to implement a two-size system, with the exception of Zheng Yonggang, who was the chairman of the board, the company's people were not sent to Sugi Jin to do business in an authorized manner and the distribution system, business culture, management, etc. remained the same.
According to the negative data released in 2022 by the ICC, in 2022, the number of shipments from the U.S.A. in 2022 passed by 200,000 tons, an increase of 100 per cent in the same year, a market share of 16 per cent, and the number of shipments of artificial graphite material from the U.S.A.
With regard to the luminous business, Yano Research statistics show that the global market share under the company’s flag reached 29 per cent in 2022 and is expected to reach 32 per cent in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, the share of the stock of the fir-gill was 15,841 million yuan and the net profit was 2,313 million yuan. On 10 February, the share price of the share of the stock of the stock of the fir-gill was $19.24, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On 9 February, at the interactive platform, the stockholdings indicated that, at the end of 2022, the company had an effective graphite production capacity of about 100,000 tons, and that the graphite production capacity of the Myeongsan project was still on the slope.
In good faith, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and de facto controller of the stock in the fir.
SkyEnd showed that Jung Yongg had a total equity share of 40.1 per cent.
The general manager of the stock is Li Jihua, born in 1968, who served as the deputy general manager of the Southwood Energy Technology Company Ltd., Ningbo New Materials and Technology Ltd., and Ningpo Sugia Co. Ltd.
On 10 February, at the investor's interactive platform, the stockholding stated that there was no relationship between the company's senior management and the person actually in control of the company.
"Fund E Account" is here: the SEC has authorized the development of a collection and search of all funds in the name of investors - Economic Watch - a professional financial news site.
Economics Watch, journalists, Chen San, the plethora of channels for the purchase of funds makes it difficult to collect account information?
Do you always forget "small vaults"?
These issues of Ki-min are about to be resolved.
On 10 February, the CVM announced that the Fund's account E APP had been set up in mobile phone applications stores and had run public trials.
The “Fund E account” was described as providing a “one-stop” search service for individual investors for information on the accounts and shares of public funds, with the aim of addressing the distress points of industry services such as missing accounts and cumbersome inquiries by a wide range of small and medium-sized investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022 there were 156 public fund managers in the country, managing about $26 trillion in size; 167 public fund share registers and 411 public fund sales agencies.
The system of accounts of the various quota registers is independent of each other and lacks uniform access to the industry.
According to industry, at the end of 2021 there were more than 720 million investors in our Fund, i.e. half of the country's population invested in its products.
Previously, investors had had to search for purchases through different sales agencies, while the “fund E account” provided access to all sales channels, and the holding of funds was clear.
What is the “Fund E Account” APP?
According to the relevant documents, the “Fund E account” APP is a one-stop shop application for China's clearing and development of a PFP industry portal approved by the CSRC to provide investors with off-site shares of PGF products.
Investors can improve the efficiency of their inquiries across the board by facilitating and fast-tracking the holding of off-site shares of PGF products purchased by their respective fund managers through the sales channels of the market as a whole.
Specifically, information available to investors through the “Fund E account” includes information on fund accounts maintained by public fund administrators throughout the market, information on transactions held by public fund sales agencies and the holding of off-site shares of products such as public equity investment funds and a pool asset management scheme, which is managed by a securities firm and not limited to 200 investors.
Liu Yakchi, Officer-in-Charge of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Centre, stated to Economic Watch journalists that investors could obtain information on all their out-of-the-office fund holdings through the “Fund E account” App one-stop shop to help them recover their “forgotten assets” and, more importantly, to bring together the full account information on the investments of the Consolidated Fund for clients, and to help clients gain a more timely, accurate and complete picture of their investments so as to better optimize their portfolio and plan their own financial arrangements.
How do you register for use?
Journalists note that the Fund's account E APP is currently on board in mobile phone applications such as China, Apple, Mi, OPPO, and vivo, but that the APP is still in the public trial phase and registration requires an invitation code, which is available to investors in contact with the fund manager of the fund in which it is held.
A six-digit invitation code was given to an economic watch reporter by a large Chinese public fund in Shanghai, and the journalist was told that “China's settlement provides a certain number of invitations to each fund manager during the APP trial operation, and investors call and we will provide them.
When the test runs are completed, the user registration will be opened without the invitation number.
It's not the same as the rest of the rest of the world.
Journalists registered their accounts and completed their inquiries on the basis of the “Fund E account” published by the network of CSROs and using the relevant documentation. The process took only a few minutes and was divided into four main steps: user registration, real name certification, fund account binding, and fund-raising inquiries.
After the physical name certification step, click on the “assets” fund binding button, and all Fund products purchased by journalists through the respective fund sales platforms are presented in the binding options list (an account that can be tied), which allows for direct viewing of the total assets of the invested fund and the start-up of the query function.
It is worth noting that the “Fund E account” provides a search service only for investors and does not allow for foreclosure.
The data date shown in Fund E accounts is generally the date on which the user made a query (T-day) and three transaction days forward.
For example, the Fund E account was opened on 10 February, and the corresponding date for total assets, fund shares and net value of funds shown on the asset sheet was three transaction days ahead of that date, that is, 7 February.

We've reached a consensus on defense with the Communist Party of the United States of America.
Asia – On 9 February, the President of the Philippines, Bongbong Marcos, visited Japan to meet with Prime Minister Kishida.
After the meeting, the leaders issued a joint statement in which they agreed to oppose the violations of the South and East Seas by the CCP, stating that substantive defence exchanges would take place through the signing of a trilateral defence agreement with the United States and against the policy of hegemony by the CCP.
According to the Japanese media, Kishida-kun hopes to use this meeting to help the two countries establish a policy against the crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
Little Marcos visited China early in January this year and obtained an agreement worth $20 billion.
But after that, not only did the Sino-Phi relationship not improve, but it went backwards.
Early this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open additional bases to United States forces to provide security in the South China Sea.
A new base, 300 kilometres from Taiwan, is also the closest to China.
In the event of a crisis in Taiwan, United States forces could launch operations at bases in the Philippines.
The Japanese media believe that Japan and Taiwan, and even the Philippines, now form an axis with the United States to build a “combating the CCP” in the Western Pacific Ocean to promote regional cooperation.
During the visit of the Vice-President of the National Party, Shatun SONG said: "We welcome the Green Camp to the land under the 92nd Consensus."
On this visit, the Vice-President of the China National Party of Taiwan said that he had met with the Director of the Chinese State Office, Song Tao, and the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Yi Ning.
Zhao Chunshan, Senior Adviser, State Administration Foundation, an official agency of the National Party, interviewed Taiwan Central Agency last night to positively evaluate Song Tao's statements against Xia, saying that China would welcome Green Campers to visit the mainland as long as it agrees with the 92nd Consensus and anti-Taiwan independence.
On the part of the National Party, it was assessed as something new.
This statement was not mentioned in the news on the day he spoke earlier about his meeting with Song Tao.
Taiwan's ruling PNP has been clarifying its rejection of the 92nd Consensus.
According to the Central Society today, the Vice-President of the National Party led a delegation to Luo, where he met with Wang Yi Ning, the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Central Communist Party, the new Director of the National Office, Song Tao, and the Secretary of the Beijing City Council, Yoon Li, respectively, during Beijing.
During a meeting with Song Tao on the political basis of the National Republic, the 92nd Consensus and the anti-Taiwan independence, Zhao Chunshan, Senior Adviser to the National Political Foundation of the National Party, stated that the 92nd Consensus of the National Party was the original 92nd Consensus.
Zhao Chunshan's analysis is different from the previous meetings in which he participated.
Recent discussions with the continental community, as well as this one, did not hear from the Taiwanese scholars about martial arts and “anti-secession laws”, which were replaced by the resumption of communication and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan stated that the fighting on both sides of the border was in danger and that China looked forward to conveying its intention to improve relations through the National Party.
Since there was no mutual trust between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Korea, the other side remained willing to work well with the people of Taiwan, and the representative did not wish to spoil cross-Straits relations.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Xiaoning personally instructed Song Tao to “show them what they (Taiwan farmers and fishermen) demand, you must do so” and, if it is not possible to do so in a comprehensive manner, take a case-by-case approach.
The report did not mention whether the visit of the National Party to the mainland had referred in person to the daily harassment of Chinese military ships, the issue of agricultural fisheries in a small number of Taiwan counties and cities, and whether interviews with Central News Agency journalists had asked such questions.
The French trade union has again mobilized the anti-government retirement reform program march.
On Saturday, 11 February, the French trade unions again launched a national campaign against the Government's draft pension reform, calling on the population to take to the streets and express their views.
This is the fourth day of action of the social trend against the proposed reform of the government pension system.
How many people responded to the call for a rally could affect the next course of action of trade union groups.
For the fourth time since this month, eight major French trade union groups have jointly launched a national mobilization, and for the first time in this protest, the gathering was scheduled for Saturday.
Since, for most French, Saturday is a public holiday, and they do not have to choose between taking part in a demonstration or a wage strike, trade union groups hope that today's rally will attract more participants.
The trade unions of the public transport system, iron and public railway companies, do not today call for workers to strike, the public transport system should be functional, citizens could travel by car to the meeting place, and people could take regular leave of absence in areas where the school had begun winter holidays.
Trade union groups hope that more than a million people will be able to attend the rally today, and that the police will expect a national participation of between 600,000 and 800,000, and that the city of Paris will gather between 90,000 and 120,000.
Since the beginning of this anti-Government pension reform programme protest, the number of people actually taking part in the march on the streets has gradually decreased, although polls indicate that most French do not support measures to raise the mandatory retirement age from the current 62 to 64 years.
The first strike on 31 January gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people throughout the country.
This Tuesday (7 February) demonstrations have shrunk between 757 and 2 million people across the country.
The pension reform programme is currently under discussion in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, particularly the opposition group led by the radical left, have submitted numerous proposals for amendments to the extent that the review process has moved very slowly.
The debate between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is becoming more acute.
The radical left-wing French party, a member of the non-substantiation party, had recently sent a picture of his foot in the social media of a balloon bearing the head of the Minister of Labour, triggering protests by the ruling party.
The President of the National Assembly eventually declared that the member of Parliament was prohibited from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for such acts.
Despite the fact that this reform programme has triggered the largest social wave in France in more than two decades, the Government has so far made no major concessions, despite some minor adjustments to the draft.
The trade unions were ready to launch their action again next Thursday, 16, and on 7 March, when the draft reform was sent to the Senate for discussion, they also planned to organize demonstrations.
China encourages the promotion of high fertility rates and high quality in higher education.
In Yunnan Province, China, the Human sperm bank issued an information campaign on 9 occasions to solicit donations from university graduates or students, and successfully donated 8 to 12 times to receive subsidies in the amount of RMB 4,500.
According to today's media reports, the message was launched on the same day and triggered follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to the signed report of the Freedom Times, Chinese university students are encouraged to donate sperm.
Among these, higher education institutions have the highest threshold for Beijing contributions, requiring more than 170 centimetres of height, five officers of integrity, no apparent loss of hair, and no more than 600 degrees of near-sightedness, in addition to academic qualifications.
According to the report, according to the Human sperm bank in Yunnan Province, the donor has access to a full male medical examination valued at RMB 1,000, “especially for semen and chromosomes, most of whom have never done so, and which is important for understanding their reproductive state”.
The conditions for donors include those with height of 165 cm, college and above, or studying, colourless blindness, liver B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
Quoting the Chinese Tianxing News, the report states that Tianxi Province's human sperm bank has a poster entitled “Reimburst donation, infinity”, calling on young people to respond to it, and encouraging online users to transmit messages to “let love pass”.
The price of Shaanxi Province is higher than that of Yunnan and eligible persons receive RMB 300 in cash each time, while those who complete a certain number of sperm donors receive RMB 5,000 in subsidies.
The highest prices are currently known in Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of RMB 5150.
The last Communist Prime Minister in East Germany died today.
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement to the party that “last night Hans Modrow left us and was 95 years old.
As a result, our party lost an important leader.
It's not the same as the rest of the rest of the world.
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which separated East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, Modero stated that he would help transform East Germany into a democratic State.
At that time, Communist leaders were forced to step down because protesters throughout East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After coming to power in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev called for changes in Soviet-led Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Modero declared the first and only free election of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
As a result of the elections, he was no longer Prime Minister.
Despite the reforms undertaken by Modero, the opponents accused him of attempting to delay the political changes and reunification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for attempting to reconstitute, rather than abolish, the secret police.
In 1993, Modero was convicted of electoral fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989 but was not imprisoned.
These allegations are said to be politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modero continued to serve in the German Parliament and served as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modero sees himself as a reformer and wishes to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not wish to return to the old East Germany, but that his achievements should be acknowledged.
Modero was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now the Polish Jasienica) and was trained as a mechanic.
During the Second World War, he headed the youth fire brigade and became a member of the Nazi militia organization Volkssturm, which recruited men between 16 and 60 years of age to participate in the final war struggle at the end of the conflict.
At 17 years of age, Modero was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a committed communist.
In 1949, the year in which East Germany was founded, he returned home and found a mechanic's job and continued his studies in social sciences and economics and obtained a doctorate.
Modero was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, in which almost all young people from East Germany joined and were promoted to the chairmanship of the Dresden Regional Party through the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) between 1973 and 1989.
He also served in the East German Parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modero became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest State office.
Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution.
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official gathering on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Lacey's televised speech.
The President's televised speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, and a group of anti-Iranian hackers, named “Edalat Ali (Ali Justice),” appeared on the screen.
There was also a voice chanting “Die to the Islamic Republic”.
According to Reuters today, Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution and hackers interrupt national television coverage.
Iranian officials commemorated the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, and Lacey's hard-line government faced the boldest challenge posed by the young protesters who asked them to step down, but Lacey continued to call for “swindling youth” to repent so that they could be pardoned by the highest Iranian leadership.
Amini Mahsa Amini, 22, died in September in the custody of the moral police in the country, and protests continued throughout the country in Iran.
The deadly repression of protests by Iranian security forces has been one of the most powerful challenges facing the Islamic Republic since the revolution of 1979, when the 2500-year monarchy was overthrown.
As part of the amnesty to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution, the Iranian authorities released on Friday the imprisoned dissident Fahd Mesami and the Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha, who were on hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) had issued an amnesty decree that included a number of prisoners arrested during recent anti-Government protests.
According to the human rights organization HRANA, 528 protesters, including 71 minors, had been killed as of Friday.
A further 70 Government security personnel were reportedly killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For several weeks, Iranian leaders and the official media have called for a vote at Saturday's rally to demonstrate their opposition to protests and support for the Government.
On Friday night, on the anniversary of the Iranian revolution, the official media showed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebrations, chanting “Allahu Akbar!”
God is the greatest!"
However, the rally also heard many shouting, "Death to the dictator!"
"The Death of the Islamic Republic" in social media videos.
On Saturday, Government television broadcast live videos of official meetings in all states of the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, the national production of anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment was demonstrated.
President Lacey's speech was frequently interrupted by the slogan “Die America” — a signpost at a state rally.
The crowd also shouted “Death to Israel”.
Reuters states that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of the seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor that has contributed to the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years'imprisonment in 2020 on charges of national security.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah denied these allegations.
A week before his release, his supporters warned that he was at risk of death as a result of a hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the forced wearing of a headscarf.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to the release of Adelkhah on Friday, called for the restoration of her freedom “including that she should be allowed to return to France if she so wishes.
It's not the same as the rest of the rest of the world.
The balloon incident shines more American eyes?
Increased restrictions on the export of technology to China
According to the Wall Street Journal today, following the balloon incident, the United States intends to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials have stated that the above-mentioned balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China and will generate more political support for strengthening United States technical protection.
The United States stated that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a senior official of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), currently serving in the Washington think tank, the new American security center.
“This undoubtedly fuels the fire and supports the views of the hardliners of China”.
The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said to the press on Thursday, “We will also consider wider action to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and to our allies and partners.
United States officials stated that they had informed Governments in more than 30 countries of the above-mentioned balloon incident and that international coordination was essential to respond to the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that, in addition to the actions of the Biden Government, the newly established United States-China Communist Party Special Committee on Strategic Competition in the United States House of Representatives might also pressure the United States to take stricter measures to slow China's development.
She said that parliamentarians would be under increasing pressure to take a stronger stance, which in turn might force the White House to adopt stronger policies.
According to the Wall Street Journal, many advocates of stricter export controls are also promoting the expansion of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The United States Government is also in the process of developing an outward investment review plan to examine whether United States investments abroad pose a potential national security threat from China.
According to analysts, the White House may face calls for a faster roll-out of the plan.
Day after day of earthquake relief in Syria
Since the devastating earthquake in Turkey and the accompanying Syrian Arab Republic, relief teams from dozens of countries have worked hard day and night in the ruins of thousands of seismic structures to save the survivors buried under the rubble.
In cold temperatures, they often call for silence because they struggle to hear any sound of life from the broken concrete piles.
According to Reuters today, two more women were rescued from the ruins of the earthquake several days later.
However, the number of deaths caused by the earthquake rose to 24,150.
There were 20,665 deaths in Turkey and more than 3,500 deaths in Syria.
On Monday, the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which continued several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh most deadly natural disaster of the century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighbouring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in north-western Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
The Turkish authorities indicated on Saturday that two women had been trapped for 122 hours after 20 years of the most deadly earthquake in the area and that rescue workers had rescued them from the ruins of the collapsed buildings in Turkey.
Another 55-year-old man was identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in Diabakr, the largest city in south-eastern Turkey.
In cold temperatures, rescuers often call for silence, as they struggle to hear any sound of life from broken concrete piles.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescue workers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering “Inshallah” — “God bless” — they carefully stretched their hands into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old newborn child.
He opened his eyes and the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and taken to the field hospital.
The video showed that the paramedics had also taken his mother, who was dazed and pale on the stretcher, but sober.
The Vice-President of Turkey, Fuat Oktay, told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours and that 31,000 rescue workers had been used in the affected areas.
He said that some 80,000 people had been treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people had been rendered homeless by the earthquake and had been confined to temporary shelters.
As many people suffer from a lack of food in cold winter conditions, the response of the leaders of the two countries to the disaster is increasingly being questioned by the population.
According to the official Syrian media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad travelled with his wife Asma to a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly for the first time since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme indicated that its stocks in the rebel-controlled north-western part of Syria were running out because the state of war complicated relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdoğan visited Adyaman Province, Turkey, where he acknowledged that the Government's response had not been as rapid as expected.
The opponents seized the issue and attacked Erdoğan, who would run for re-election in the May 14 poll, but could be delayed by disaster.
Reuters stated that anger over delays in the delivery of assistance and the initiation of relief efforts could have an impact on the elections.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge in Erdoğan's 20-year reign.
Erdoğan called for solidarity and condemned what he called “negative movements for political gain”.
Kemal Kilidaroglu, the leader of the main opposition party in Turkey, criticized the response of the Government.
Critics say that “the earthquakes are large, but more severe than the earthquakes are the lack of coordination, planning and incompetence.
It's not the same as the rest of the rest of the world.
On the morning of 11 February, the Prime Minister of the Government of Viet Nam, Mr. and Mrs. Van Mingjing, visited the University of Brunei Lussaland (UBD) during the visit to Brunei Darussalam, as reported by the Viet Nam News Agency-The Viet Nam News Agency Special Reporter.
The University of Brunei is the largest centre for higher education and scientific research in Brunei and ranks third in the list of universities in the region.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of cooperation between Viet Nam and Brunei in education and training.
The Brunei University formally established a partnership with the Vietnamese FPT University in July 2013, the main area of cooperation being English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese and Korean, Vietnamese is also included in the curriculum of the University of Brunei.
During his visit to Brunei University, the Prime Minister of the Government of Viet Nam, Mr. and Mrs. Fan Mingjing, interacted with students in Vietnamese language classes.
Prime Minister Fan Mingjing was pleased that an increasing number of foreigners liked to learn Vietnamese, thus making a positive contribution to the spread of Viet Nam's cultural identity and landscape to all parts of the world.
The Government's Prime Minister, Fan Mingjing, expressed confidence and hope that the Vietnamese language teaching staff at Brunei University will grow stronger; the participants in the Vietnamese language classes are increasingly interested in Vietnamese, working hard to learn, being able to use fluent Vietnamese at an early date and serving as an ambassador for friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Fan Mingjing also interacted via video with Vietnamese students who were learning English at the FPT-UBD Global Centre in Hong Kong City to learn about their learning, particularly during the epidemic.
The Government Prime Minister, Pham Mingjing, believes that the cooperative relationship between FPT University and Brunei University of Viet Nam, in particular the FPT-UBD Global Centre, is a vivid symbol of Viet Nam's educational cooperation with Brunei.
It is also hoped that the students of the Centre will make further progress in their studies and make a positive contribution to the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
During discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and the leadership of Brunei University, Prime Minister Fan Mingzhing valued the effectiveness of educational cooperation between the two countries, including cooperation between FPT University and Brunei University, as well as the initiative of Brunei University to include Vietnamese in the curriculum.
Prime Minister Fan Mingjing expressed the hope that the University of Brunei would continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expanding the size of Vietnamese language classes.
The Government of Viet Nam's Prime Minister, Pham Mingjing, also valued the positive results of the cooperation between the two countries based on the memorandum of understanding on educational cooperation signed in April 2014 and recommended that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and to effectively carry out short-term swap training programmes such as the Global Exploration Project (Global Discovery Programme), the Year of Exploration (Discovery Year).
Prime Minister Fan Mingjing highly appreciated the establishment by Brunei University of its first branch in South-East Asia in Viet Nam; believed that the University was growing in scale in the region and in the world; and further expanded its cooperation with Vietnamese institutions of higher learning.
On this occasion, Prime Minister and Mrs. Fan Mingjing planted a memorial tree on the campus of the University of Brunei and left a message in the memorial book.
Prime Minister Fan Mingjing wishes the University of Brunei to keep moving forward, to contribute increasingly to Bruneian education and to further and broader cooperation with various educational and training institutions in Viet Nam.

Yakuza.
Viet Nam's official visit to Singapore and Brunei by the Prime Minister of Viet Nam, Fan Mingjing and the couple, was successful and produced comprehensive, practical and concrete results, as reported by the News Agency Hanoi-Viet Nam special reporter.
During the three days of the mission to Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Fan Mingjing participated in more than 30 different events.
The results achieved have given new impetus to the development of the new two-State strategic partnership and the Viet Nam comprehensive partnership in a deeper, broader and more effective direction.
During his visit to both countries, Prime Minister Fan Mingjing continued to reaffirm the Viet Nam Party and the country's external routes, namely independence, pluralism and change, and was ready to be good friends and reliable partners for all countries, as well as responsible members of the international community.
Strengthened relations with Singapore and Brunei are the needs of their respective countries, committed to the well-being of their peoples and to peace, stability and development in the region and the world.
At the various meetings and talks, Prime Minister Fan Mingjing and the leaders of Singapore and Brunei agreed to continuously enhance political mutual trust with Viet Nam through the exchange of high-level delegations, effective bilateral cooperation mechanisms and important cooperation agreements.
A number of cooperation documents were signed during the visit.
Of these, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Green and Digital Economy Partnership with Singapore and the Plan of Action for the Strengthening of the Viet Nam Comprehensive Partnership for the Period 2023-2027 with Brunei are two highlights.
Viet Nam signed a memorandum of understanding on the Green and Digital Economy Partnership with Singapore.
I can't believe I'm here.
During meetings with business leaders, seminars or participation in economic forums, Prime Minister Fan Mingjing stressed that Viet Nam welcomed and facilitated the expansion of investment by Singapore and Brunei enterprises in areas such as digital transformation, green energy, high technology and innovation in Viet Nam.
The visit not only helped to deepen Viet Nam's cooperation with Singapore and Brunei in traditional areas such as politics, diplomacy, economy, security, defence, education and training, hydrocarbons, tourism and civic exchanges, but also created cooperation frameworks for countries in new potential areas such as the digital economy, green economy, energy transformation, innovation, smart cities and sustainable development.
King Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei and Prime Minister Fan Ming are preparing for a bilateral symposium.
I can't believe I'm here.
During his visits to both countries, Prime Minister Fan Mingjing arranged to visit and listen to the thoughts and aspirations of the local Vietnamese community.
During the meeting between the leaders of both countries, Prime Minister Fan Mingjing recommended that the authorities of both countries pay more attention and create favourable conditions for the local Vietnamese community to be treated fairly, to have an opportunity to contribute to local society and to foster relations between the two countries.
This proposal was endorsed and supported by the leaders of both countries.
In particular, Prime Minister Fan Mingzhing also shared with the leaders of both countries their aspirations for an ASEAN community of solidarity, peace, stability and prosperity; and agreed to maintain solidarity and collaboration with the ASEAN countries and to enhance the central role of ASEAN in the context of the complex and volatile regional and international situation.
With the important results achieved, Prime Minister Fan Mingjing's official visit to Singapore and Brunei has made a positive contribution to the effective implementation of the 13-year Viet Nam-wide external route to strengthen relations with ASEAN neighbours, to the effective implementation of Conclusion No. 12 (12-KL/TW) of the Central Political Bureau of Viet Nam on Viet Nam's diaspora work in the new situation, and to the full force of national unity.

And what is the object that was shot down?
There's a lot of speculation.
The U.S. military again used U.S. state-of-the-art invisible jet F-22 in the afternoon of Friday (10 February) to shoot down an unidentified object flying airbornely in U.S. Alaska.
The shooting took place 10 miles from the Alaskan coast.
This is the second time in less than a week that the United States forces have shot down an aerial object.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted over United States airspace and was destroyed several days later near the coast of South Carolina, United States.
According to the Pentagon, the second shot-down object entered United States airspace for the first time on Thursday night and was followed by the United States military as it moved over north-east Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 metres (40,000 feet) similar to that of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was previously shot down.
The Pentagon also considered that there was no indication that the object was manoeuvrable at the present time.
The White House National Security Council strategic communication coordinator, John Kirby, stated on Friday that, while the specifics of the object flying at high altitude were not yet clear, it posed “a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft”.
Corby indicated that, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, the object did not have a payload on it.
Kirby said, “We call it an `object' that is the best description we can make today”.
President Biden heard the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the shooting down of the object, which he took was “very cautious”, added by Kirby.
The official description of the object in the United States can be broadly summarized as: a car of the size of which there is no handler, no hanging device and an altitude of about 10,000 metres.
However, the information could not answer basic questions, such as what the object was, what country it belonged to and what task it was carrying out.
A lot of analysis and speculation on the Internet now suggests that this could be another Chinese balloon.
It may come from China, like the spy balloon that invaded American airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, and they perform certain missions in different locations.
This “object” in Alaska was also associated with the “unknown flight object” (UFO).
The story of the United States Newsweek quotes former United States Congressman Peter Meijer's tweet on Friday, saying, “It's true hope that this `unknown flyer' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO”.
“The irony of mixing alien spaceships with meteorological balloons is surprising, but it is not worth triggering an interstellar conflict,” said Major.
Major sent this tweet shortly after Kirby confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
According to Newsweek, the object was suspected of being a UFO and not just a Major.
Tim Burchett, Congressman of the Republican Party of Tennessee, criticized the Government's practice of concealing information last month and asked the Office of the Director-General of National Intelligence (DNI) to publish reports on “unknown flying objects”.
I can't believe the hospitality of the Amazon.
Very few people are expected to see it here, but I'm going to say it a little bit.
And this dress was a zipper when we bought it, and it was finally given to me as a short sleeve.
Upon receipt of the clothing, contact was made with the Amazon passenger service, confirming that the clothing was still in stock, and I asked for a change, and the client's advice was taken care of and immediately saw the trade name turned into a short sleeve, the link I had bought was down.
The customer service notice then either retains a certain amount of compensation for the goods or returns the goods.
That's the way the Amazon handles it?
It's really hard to believe that it's not my fault that my clothes were wrong. As a consumer, I asked for what I was supposed to get, and I made no exaggeration, while the Amazon changed its name and said there was no stock.
That's my first long comment, I hope it's not my last one.
Ununderstandable sleeves.
It's a cow's skin, it's a hard one, but when you look at it, there's a lot of small cracks, it's not clear whether it's real or not, and the sleeves of this dress are hard to understand. Usually the sleeves of the jackets are longer than the shirts, but they are usually 1 to 2 centimetres long, and the arm is naturally drawn to the top of the hand, but the sleeves of the jacket are covered with fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes, and it's easy to return them.
But when does it have to be paid back?
The clothes work well, because they're small, they have to be returned, but after returning the goods, it's been over a week now and no refunds have been received?
And it's the worst shopping ever since you bought Amazon's stuff!
But the shopkeeper was very good, and he was very active in pushing the courier to pay back in a timely fashion, but this whole trip was quite an outrage and took about a half-month to pay back, a partner who was trying to drag Amazon's backsliding, inefficient, unserviceable!
It's better for young people.
Ninety-nine seconds to kill.
The knickers are good at work, colours, handsight, soft/breathy, no kerosene.
Unfortunately, the layout is thin and more suitable for young people.
3XL, flattened by 2'5', stretched by a maximum of 4'4', and 1.79'80' kg was a little tight on the waist.
It seems that there are no loose belts in the waist and it is difficult to untie the waist.
Besides, it's uncomfortable to wear close clothes.
That's good. It's not very colorful.
It just went up by over 200. What's the situation?
The first Amazon co-operative delivery, the first out-of-home delivery, the first out-of-pocket delivery, the first out-of-pocket delivery, the first out-of-pocket delivery, the first out-of-pocket delivery, the deliveryer, who refused to deliver the delivery, returned the delivery directly to me, the damn deliveryer had no good faith, and it was strongly recommended that the daily delivery should not be repeated.
This time, I've got another shirt back and the price has increased by more than a hundred.
Amazon self-employed shouldn't be like this.
The product is purchased at special prices, which are not low, and the review is also a good product.
When the product was actually received, I was stunned by the extensive wear and tear on the surface of the commodity, as well as by wear and tear in many other places, either as a secondary or as a used product, which will be shown later.
I'm applying for a return. The guy at the factory saw the picture and said it was a shipment. Isn't that bullshit?
How is it possible to wear it inside a commodity?
There are only two possibilities, namely, to destroy the goods intentionally and return them.
Objectively, I have no proof that I did not damage the merchandise, but in terms of my credit records for shopping in the Amazon, I believe that such a commodity should not appear in Amazon self-employed commodities, that the client chooses Amazon self-employed is trust, and the winner of the client is the winner of the manufacturer, and I hope you will work together to improve it. Thank you.
I've been using this product for less than a year, and there's two E2. I don't know how to handle it.
I bought the commodity on 30 July 2015, but in March 2016 two groups on the right of the receiver frequently appeared red E2, which should be a launch module problem, which is not quite consistent with the seven-year sustainability of the launch module described on the Amazon website, and is not available for sale on the Amazon website.
It's okay.
The first purchase is bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The tags on the box were torn and the labels on the machine were broken.
And it's always white screen.
I'll change it later.
It's pretty fast, it's a little blurry at night, it's not very broad, but it's enough for ordinary homes.
It's not good enough to have a card, it's good to buy it, and it's good to buy a cell phone in Amazon.
There will be stickers on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened. Not this time, there will be a sticker chapter on the mobile phone that can be placed on the warrant card, not this time.
I don't know if something's cheap. There's nothing. I'm confused.
Waiting for supplier response
Packagings are not marked, and direct calls are made to the supplier saying that the answer is not marked as authentic, such as if it is suspected that they can be mailed to Johnson and Johnson and leave a plate number and a phone number, promising to send a text message informing me to enter my information into the Johnson and Johnson Net warrant and not receiving a text yet?
Got the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon self-employed goods are reassuring.
The oil changer says it's bright, it's really good oil.
Because it was the second time.
That's why I'm so relieved.
The speed of the delivery, the place where the packaging is not picky, the oil is used and the sound of the engine is clearly down.
The price is good, it's hard to find synthetic oil under 200.
Support the star crown, support the medallion, and effective protection of the car.
The interests of buyers in the Japanese Amazon were severely impaired due to customer service problems (8c for caterpillars with 8 cm for caterpillars) (8c = 14 cm, 8 cm = 2 c)
The error was admitted, but it continued to be pushed, always emphasizing that the goods were third parties and could not be bound by third parties.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I bought a page size option of 7c, 8,9c, which I thought was a trap, called a Japanese-Chinese customer service, and clearly informed 8c, but when the merchandise returned to China, it was only 8cm, and I think it was a set-up trap to trap the Chinese (in line with Amazon sales), and now there is no such option for looking at the page.
Chinese hospitality: I'm sorry for the loss. We'll give you two roads:
One, you return the goods, the buyer pays for all the freight.
Two, if you don't return the goods, we'll make it up to you for 1,000 yen.
I'll take the books, I'll take the shoes for more than 4,000 yen, it's 200 rmb, option 1, I don't have the shoes, I lose the 200 yen.
Option 2, I have shoes, and I am finally compensated for 2,000 yen, and the final loss is at 150 rmb: we've recorded it, we'll take it seriously, we'll return an e-mail the following day, saying I don't accept Chinese interrogatories, and that's it.
I suggested that when the page was purchased for a confusing option such as 7c, 8,9c, China's customer service helped me to say that Japan's usual code would not be like this, like 140, but did you go to any other caterpillar page?
It's all beautiful, and there's a day-code mix.
Besides, why do you put 8cm in the middle of 7c and 9c with the smallest size? What do you mean by that?
Chinese hospitality: We offer Chinese services, but we do not know that you are going back to China, so we will not pay for your freight costs.
I don't understand this logic anymore. I'm Japanese. I need Chinese service. I don't need Chinese service in China. I don't need Chinese service in Japan.
Isn't that what the Amazon Chinese people are doing to make it easier for us?
This is not a good purchase.
This is the second time that the baby buys a pavilion diaper from Amazonia, once bought a box of paper diapers for the baby's two months, chose to import paper from Europe. The first purchase was more satisfactory. The baby used a diaper all night and did not change diapers for 12 hours.
This time, however, two bags of diapers for the L were packed separately in one case, and when they were opened, the paper became looser, clearly different from the imported treasure, and after it was used for the baby, it was possible, there was no leaking urine or signs of rash, etc.
But by the second bag of diapers, a rash appeared on the inside of the baby's thigh after it began to be used and has not yet faded.
Two bags in one box are suspected to be of different quality.
I don't think I'll buy any more!
I'd like to focus on package transport protection.
This is the worst package transport I've seen for so long, with no protection at all, buffer foams, packaged buffers, nothing.
Just a deformed box.
And the flap box in it is packed, and the card box is pressurized to deformation.
Hope it's the real thing that's got quality assurance, and later on, you don't buy anything from Amazons.
I'd rather have half the price in the country and a safe spot.
And on the issue of packaging of commodity products, I have seen comments in 2016, and it has been the same for 19 years now.
This shows that the Amazon does not attach much importance to the piece of feedback on services, which is far from the Kyoto and Skycats in the country.
It's nice, but it's a little sad.
The color of the whole cup is my favorite, orange red, and although my family's a man's treasure, it's still very bright with the yellow.
It's smaller than I thought, but it's used to take it out of the house, so it's acceptable.
Having taken it home last night, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close after the cap had been pushed out, since the straw was located in a vertical direction, so the son always had to hold the top of the cap to drink water and wondered if the place could be improved.
It seems that other labels of straw cups slant the straws, and the children's things really care about safety and comfort.
Leather capacity
Like, it's light, it's big, it's like two separate separate bags are a little redundant for me, and I don't know what to put in.
After buying it, it was discovered that one of the other brands on the U.S.A. was similar, and it was less than $200.
It's a fake. It's a fake.
Amazon sells fakes, and so do I.
I don't know if it's fake.
It's because of trust, so sad, after all, it's a face-washing item. Go to the real store and buy it. Make sure it's more expensive.
Because it's a second kill, so there's no comment. I've already submitted it to the electronics platform of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Let's do it together.
Broken?
Fake?
In short, tragedy.
The puncture that was chosen in the second film was very delicate, but it was a strange smell, which it thought was normal as soon as it was opened, because it was not used, and then it was stuck on the face, and the smell was so intense that it could not be described, so the eyes were sore, tears were shed, and the face was immediately removed.
Unbelief opens up the same thing, it doesn't smell that much, it's putting it on.
It's kind of like bad hot water in the hairdresser.
Can't imagine that Amazon's own skin preserves have to be avoided from now on?
You're a traitor.
At the time of the purchase, the campaign page said that 99 dollars was a gift for the whole of the three bodies, that there was no such gift, that there was a phone call for them to see a screenshot of the activities at the time, that the problem was who bought the items and kept the screenshots, that you had your own activities, that you needed the customers to provide them, and that the buyers would have to keep an eye on the evidence next time.
It's an afterthought.
First of all, there is no pain, there is no irritation. In general, it's nice to wait eight minutes or so, but there's a small amount of sweaty dust on it. It doesn't look like it, so it's all good, and then it's going to have to be seen again, and it's going to be used again.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
Second, the delivery was received from entry number 27, number 12, for a total of 15 days or half a month, and the Amazon's deliveryers were also well served.
Thirdly, on the black Fridays of the Amazon, when it comes down to Fridays, it takes two days to get close to $12, i.e., I buy more than 170 (with freight or something) and I feel like I'm getting paid for it.
I've been concerned about price volatility for more than 10 days, and it's not too volatile.
Prices are good, Japanese is good, Chinese labels are good, granules are good!
The gypsum, with the particles in it, is right. It's smooth with its rear teeth, it's much better than a second-hand easter. It says it's imported, but it doesn't have a Chinese label, and it's distributed somewhere.
As long as there is one in the Amazon, you will never go back to second-hand.
Give me a suggestion. Amazon's apps can't get out of the sun sometimes, hoping to improve some applications, they'll get better and better!
All these years of excellence, it's getting worse and worse, and there's no service at all!
Garbage is excellent and does not take into account the needs of clients.
Because of the presence of elderly people in the home who are unable to sleep after surgery, only evenings are available for receipt.
As a result, he went to the door at 12 noon and did not call in advance.
If the delivery time is whatever you want, why do you have to pretend to let the client choose?
If your own logistics doesn't guarantee the service, then don't be a power dealer!
Get an old man out of bed with three wounds and pick up a delivery for change!
There's a phone call on the order!
No one's called from the beginning to explain!
The so-called customer service of the Network of Excellence is a bunch of outsiders there who act like they're lying about your complaint and then give you a so-called answer.
There will be no change or compensation!
I've had the same problem with distribution times, but I can't bear it this time. It's too much!
After the sale of the new book, the cover and the bottom of the cover are counterproductive, so it's obvious that the quality problem is just to close your eyes and send the book to the customer?
No one will be able to contact you.
All these years of excellence, it's getting worse and worse, and there's no service at all!
No more spending a dime on excellence.
The quality of the pictures is unacceptable.
As a title such as the Ancient Atlas, the book's selection, layout and printing of pictures are simply unacceptable, and some even have Marseilles, which are so vague that they are indiscreet.
Even if the book is not a professional atlas, and even if it is a small illustration, it should be able to cope with the ancient and ancient literature of the ancient view in the catalogue!
What difference does it make to not using a book?
I'm sorry for the spirit of healing.
Textual aspects are not evaluated and can be distinguished from one another.
The whole two stars.
The book that was read at the time of his second year was just a boring look at the game, and it felt like it wasn't a fascination of itself, after all, the text from the beginning was still not very attractive to me in the past.
And then... it fell into the pit.
According to this scenario, the whole book is easier and more pleasant, and even when the former leaf is still in the net, even when there is an inter-congregation, it is not so heavy because it is often blooded by a Yip dog.
And as for the part of the game, it's written about how old and new the times have changed a little bit sore (perhaps I'm sentimental).
It took me a lot of study time to read the whole book, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time depiction of characters and emotional lines is amazing, and some of them are taken only occasionally and leave a deep legacy, as is the case with the more focused characters, who have a lot of fans and who are less popular than the writing centre, such as the Jiangbot Chu Yun Show, who cannot find a very annoying character in an electric contest, which is a full-time success in character writing.
And on the emotional front, there is no typical weblog of 30 million beautiful women or rotting women, and there is a common place for all of them to share that they like to honor the game, and most want to win in a proper manner.
Small measure has no big plot, and everyone looks so simple and cute.
This may also be why there is no objectionable role for full-time work.
The full-time IP is large and thanks to that.
Beyond the cultural phenomenon of Internet, full-time is a good book.
How much he really gives people some hot blood, a little bit touched.
This April will be a full-time oscillation.
It's been a long time since you wanted to buy this book because you never had a thick wallet, and then when you wanted to buy it, you found that the tb was full of fakes. In fact, a full-time version was recently produced. I liked the cover sheet, but I wanted to buy the old one first, so I looked at it in Amazon and bought it one at a time.
Let's move on to a brief description of the shipment.
• The fourth book is not plasticized, but the book is new.
• The seventeenth plastic seal was opened but the quality of the book was strangely felt as no other hard.
• The same is true for the 23rd and 17th editions, but they are also more rigid than the 17th, but very old.
• The publishers of individual books appear to be the same publishers as 23 and 17, as well as others.
• Satisfied overall, with 24 large boxes of satisfaction.
The fallen lion.
When you get the book, you think it'll be as simple as Lost Point, and there's still a lot of text.
I read it three times before I finished it for my little friend, a little lion who only shoots, a little lion who likes to eat juicy fudge.
When it comes to the fact that lions eat hunters, they feel a little uncomfortable, and modern-day urban people have a little bit of a problem with arrangements such as being eaten by animals.
At the end of the day, this little lion, who has succeeded in human society, has lost himself, and he is no longer a lion, nor is he a complete human being.
In the end, only the little lion's back doesn't know where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this young lion remains in the image of a grown-up child, remembered at some point unwittingly, perhaps touched or inspired her.
It's a collection of high-value works.
1. TASCHEN was not previously known and has recently bought a lot of their books because it is too tough, both in the choice of topics and in the production itself.
This is a series of three editions, the largest of which, like the Michelangelo collection, is close to 50 centimetres long and 34 centimetres wide; the medium version is about 36 centimetres long and 23 centimetres wide; this is the smallest version and is accompanied by two books in a box.
Personally, it is also acceptable to have a cheap price and more than 700 pages divided into two volumes, which are also better viewed as a plain copy; and secondly, unlike the Michelangelo collection, which is dominated by the painting, Da Vinci, which is the bulk of the black and white manuscript, the most expensive for a budget-limited, non-artistic professional reader to appreciate the painting and the manuscript.
2. The drawing section is very good, with an analysis of the drawings, draft analysis and historical background (such as the final dinner), but it is not known whether it is printing or book size, and some of the shadowy districts are too deep to see the details, and it is a matter of regret.
3 Compared to Michelangelo's manuscript, Da Vinci's manuscript is rich in content.
The former is already a genius, while the latter is too extensive and highly accomplished to describe it as such.
If only one half of Da Vinci would have been able to read the manuscript, there would have been no language at all.
Garbage, who buys who regrets!
I don't give a shit. This is a waste of money. Give me a reason!
1. Departure was not permitted and suddenly became the 1st of January, when the time came to zero.
2. Poor leather belts, which are not silicone-based, have allergie bubbles on their wrists.
3. Mobile phones are often not connected.
4. The voyage was renewed for only five days.
5. The sleep test does not show that the time is 0.
6. Non-waterproofing.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow.
We're on October 16th and we won't get it till the 21st.
The delivery's too bad. The Amazons are slow to buy. I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfactory
I was worried about the camera's packaging. This time, it's fine. It's got inflatable bags, it's three yards identical, it can be registered on the network. The number of fast doors is zero, and the rest can only wait to be tested.
I can't tell you how fast it's going to be. I can't open a box in front of him.
Businessmen did it for their customers before they delivered the goods:
Businesses are more responsible for calling and asking about the size of the screens used, and do think for their clients.
The delivery is also fast.
It's a good place to put it on. It's a good place to put it on.
Batteries aren't enough.
It's a really nice machine. I wonder why you're not happy with the first charge. The charge sign's always red.
No official Amazon feedback channels are currently available, so only in commodity evaluations
1. On March 29, the book was purchased using a pre-purchase route of $31, showing that March 31 would be delivered to the equipment, at which time Amazon officials could not preview the book on the web (because it had not yet been published);
On March 31, the book that was placed on the device was blank, only to be expected, and the cost of the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to $18;
3. Over the course of the two days, repeated attempts were made to delete the blank book downloaded from the device, synchronizing it again and making it impossible to access the electronic version " The Nature of Business ", which contains actual content, but seeing that the Amazon Network of Officials had been able to preview the book.
Now, what do I think?
The question of prices is not really the most important, but the key is how to replace the blank books on the floor with those with real content instead of downloading them forever.
2. Books purchased in advance should no longer be bought, after all, in the event of a ticket skipping and downloading an empty book, the procedure would appear to be very complicated;
3. It is hoped that the Amazon will provide a regular channel for feedback on such issues, with local feedback when downloading e-books or using doubt (worksheets, on-line service, with reference to what Microsoft Official Business City does)
Not very recommended for reading.
You read it a long time ago, and you happen to see how you feel when you write it in your memory.
The book is more about the collection of fragments of love in life than a short novel.
The pens of this book are extremely flat, like white open water, and the captions pursue the essence of brevity, in the same way as the streets of the afternoon after summer.
Every short article is a clip of a brief period of ordinary life, without an opening or an end.
And finally gathered together under the title "What are we talking about when we talk about love?"
I think that this novel, and its title, is like a behavioral art, and the author would like to express that love is more than a pessimism at the stage, a dead sea in the urban legend, and more than just your cynicism, and that love is not only and should not be represented above, and that love is a flat, empty day after day, as well as a lack of life, a real flight, a lack of future.
When you read this book, you might think about the couple you're fighting with, the odious marriage you know, and the undesired feelings.
That is why I do not recommend reading. From an aesthetic point of view, the writings and the plot of the book are boring, and unless your life is so full of horror or so sweet as to live in a candy castle, it is strange and boring that you have to read it.
And from the depth of thought, everyday circumstances do not bring light to the eyes or expand a person's thinking and vision (which is different from Marks'" Love during the Cholera " ), and the brief fragments do not address any problems, such as what mistakes have led to the failure of love?
What's the cause of the break-up of the lead man's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book. It doesn't make much sense.
The author's ideas are expressed more by skill and style than by storylines, which explains the poor reading experience of the book.
It's easy to read, not to look at.
The logic of the book is good, but it is not full enough.
Many sales theories are explained as to what they are and why, but they are weak in what they do, indicating directions but not giving specific approaches.
Besides, the book feels like a piece of work.
Examples are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs or sellers and unknown persons.
It was not clear that the story had not been compiled for illustrative purposes, and it would have been more convincing to refer to some of the cases that the authors had experienced in their own lives.
A change in the name of the customer or customer.
It's still a customer on the title, and it turns into a customer in the text.
There were also errors in the e-books, missing punctuations and errors in numbering.
In any case, the book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not very suitable for people who have already done sales work in order to increase their level of sales.
A fast-track understanding of Internet finance as a guide to reading.
The book is shallow and can be said to be an introductory lesson that can help you get a quick look at the full picture of Internet finance, but if you want to know more about it, you have to dig for yourself.
Also, earlier in the book, the subsequent use of micro-credit subsidies for payment had yet to be mentioned as a part of the user culture of the Great War, and the third party's share of the payment today was not as small as it was in the book.
Now, many people go out to eat with a cell phone, and the merchants have abandoned the silver chain because of the high level of the bank's water flow.
However, thanks go very much to the author for writing this primer, who has at least many years of experience in financial observation and is familiar with the history of financial development, both at home and abroad, in order to be able to write such an easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write about the sky. It's hard to write about it in plain language.
I like you more than I want you to know!
The first element in determining a person's job satisfaction is not a high or low salary, but a sufficient degree of attention and appreciation at work.
According to the Maslow demand-level theory, when the basic survival needs of the human person are met, the most urgent is the satisfaction of psychological needs — hope understood, affirmed and appreciated.
Indeed, for the nation, most are “love you in your heart” and even love, gratitude and appreciation remain silent.
In the present book, the author describes five expressions of appreciation: positive words, elaborate moments, acts of service, token gifts, physical contact.
I do not think it is important that you know exactly what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can at any time and from the heart of the five languages of gratitude go to the people around you, whether they be family members, friends or colleagues.
Indeed, the more close people need appreciation and gratitude, the better our lives will be.
The Society appreciates that enterprises can also retain their talent to some extent and reduce the rate of resignations.
Thanks to the translator for bringing us a wonderful foreign mind and world.
There may be more or less differences between languages due to, inter alia, the cultural background of the Central and Western world, and it is believed that more will be gained if there is an opportunity to see the original version of the author.
Thanks again to the authors and translators and editors for their hard work.
I'd like to ask the Amazon to take a critical look at what's suspected of being a pseudo-goods.
The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose, there are no weights, there are no grammes, there are no bar codes, and the 10 bags of packaging are not a feature of the qualifying product; they are the worst shopping experience in the Amazon, and they have applied for a return; they are entirely quality problems; they are recommended to the vendor to clean up his eyes and reject poor quality goods; they are added: they're also bought, the supermarket 23 dollars/10 volts, with several comparative photographs, further proof of the products' hypocrisy and, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further discomfort!
Once again, it is expected that the Amazon will be able to focus on the source of the commodities.
There's a gap between the product and the expectations.
Advantages:
1. Big brands, cheap prices.
Accomplishment 2: Both electric machines and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC and are well used, but there is a gap between my expectations.
Disadvantages:
1. The charge has no light, the most basic of your power source instructions has been saved, and customers who purchase an estimated $300 product are giving charity without respect in the eyes of PANASONIC.
2. The smell of strong plastic burning can be smelled when charged, even if it is charged for 10 minutes.
The office was tested for one day and the whole house was smelled like this plastic.
Compared to the Philips PHILIPS, which I used at the same price as before, although there was an extra knife, the quality of the product was really bad for the consumer.
Small packagings
It's smaller than the supermarket. It's M. It's different from the picture package on the merchandise, so let's call it a new one.
Three stars because they don't see the specifications. I don't care if you sell the M-code version. What do you mean you don't have it?
It's a deep set of circuits. I'll buy it at the supermarket sometime.
On the sauce purple.
It doesn't taste like it.
Kids don't like the smell of toothpaste. They always say it's hot. Maybe it's more appropriate to describe it in other words. For the time being, there's only one word in the children's vocabulary.
It's cheap, it's cheap, so I'm sorry for the bad comments. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.
It's good. It's packed.
Packaging was complete, with inflated bags in it, and no comment on the Internet was made of a product that was bare and bald.
There was also a plastic film on the overpack, as described in the picture, and the delivery was quick and came the following day.
It's the real thing. It's just gone. I don't know when I'll get on it.
A bad shopping experience.
It's been a long time since I got the order from Black Five, and when I checked, the package was already signed, and all my colleagues told me that they didn't sign it, that they had to contact the couriers, that they had to send them to start the search, that they had to contact the Amazons, that they had waited for more than 10 days to find out that the couriers had been misdelivered, that they had finally been sent back, that the outer packaging had been removed, that the goods were complete, that they had not been used, and that was a bad thing.
Wrong Drawing
I thought I could get headphones like Figure 1 but I didn't think I could get headphones like Figure 2.
Although the names were the same, it was to be hoped that care would be taken and that the Amazon officials would be asked to replace the correct drawings in a timely manner.
The operating system is normal.
For some time now, the picture was still okay, and it didn't make any difference, except that the system made people look tangled, the start-up time was obviously slow, it couldn't be set up well, the software was not to be commented on, and the speed of response was more general than that of a colleague's family.
Look at the comment that it's a very human design, and I don't find anything humane, and the remote control is a common top-down and bottom-up, and the key design is returned to a location that's not very flattering.
So, it's a TV, plus a TV box or something.
That's a lot of price cuts.
That's a lot of price reductions. Over a hundred to 99 now!
A large number of unevaluated orders have been accumulated in the Amazon, so I have consistently used a copy of the evaluation.
If I use this phrase to evaluate the product, I would say at least 85 points or more.
And worse products, I would never be lazy enough to copy paste evaluations, so that other consumers would use them as a reference at the time of purchase, and merchants would improve the quality of their goods.
That's enough if you don't have a fever!
It's a cheap line, but it's supposed to meet the hdmi certification standard, kill all this shit in the country by comparing it to the second. It's thick, it's soft, it's seven meters, it's no noise, it's a low price.
Things are fine, but Amazon's after-sales are way worse than any other website.
A mistake was discovered after the order was placed, but the cancellation of the order could not be cancelled, and the web-based contact with the on-line customer service always showed a false link and could not be contacted.
When I arrived, the deliveryman called me, and I said I didn't want it. If the order was cancelled, the deliveryer took it back and asked me to return it.
When applying for a return, the food group was informed that it would not be possible to return the goods once the receipt had been signed and that it would not be possible to call the Amazon passenger service, and the same was true of the claim that the receipt could not be returned.
I've bought policy non-refundable items in Kyoto and Suning, including milk, paper diapers, etc., the contact clothes have been withdrawn, and the smell of the contact clothes has been withdrawn since the opening of the paper diapers in Kyoutung, not until you're in Amazon.
The rules are dead. People are alive. Contact your guests.
Tell me either I take it or the sender buys it. It's not easy. Why should I get people to pay for something I didn't buy?
Fine, I won't quit either. I took it myself, but I have to give you a point in your service.
I'm telling you, don't waste your money.
First of all, I'm looking forward to buying it, and I think it's okay to look at the wrapping, but there's a box that's basically soft, and it doesn't look like it's in the outside, it's not smelly, it's not smelly, it's not tastey, it's bad, it's yellow, it's bad, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's not cheap, it's bad quality!
Eat a long and wise meal and don't buy fruit at the electric store anymore!
Where's the product security mark?
The tip of the bottom of the bottle should be so strong that it can only be caused by a strong impact. From the overpack, the degree of devastation is so disturbing. After all, the food package is too simple, it is internationally purchased, there is no obvious sign of security, the bottle is very easy to open, the key is that a layer of honey in the cover emerges directly from it, and the opening is almost non-contiguous. Is that true for foreign products?
I don't understand when I was born in China.
It's the real thing, isn't it?
And by the time I filmed the 20th, this was received on the 14th, and I bought it here overseas for the first time, just to write down my doubts, maybe it's all normal?
Delivery services need to be improved
I bought a total of five vouchers, and at the time of extraction, three were taken from the first appointment, and only two were sent, which was confirmed through multiple communications as missing and promised, and the second, just in time for the rest day, neither the website nor the micro-letters indicated the need to make an appointment on a working day, causing unnecessary panic and suggesting that it be improved in the future.
Nice shopping.
It's a good thing to say!
Still believe in Amazon self-employed goods, which are now easy to buy overseas, which have only a few days to buy back from abroad, and to say that Amazons still have a strong clearance capacity abroad, much faster than moving abroad, so much of it is now purchased overseas.
It was to be hoped that the quality and prices of domestic commodities would be better, and that much of the goods would be produced domestically, but it would be cheaper to go out and buy them back than at home, and it was hoped that they would be improved.
Garbage.
Seeing a package like this, ask everyone: Do you think it's garbage on the side of the road?
Is it responsible for a plastic package that comes from the so-called Germany with a plastic bag?
I see such packagings as garbage, buying the product, packaging it and its impregnableness, with no measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag wrapping it up, and the package is completely deformed when it comes to the hand, and the contents are broken.
If I only met one of these, I admit, and I bought a few of them, and I asked for the Amazon's services, and the customer's services said that they could be withdrawn, but the freight was advanced and the freight returned to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask you, I'll pay the freight in cash and you'll return the gift card. I'll buy your gift card and mail it to the German warehouse. It's not a crime to buy it.
And I've been telling my guests who's responsible for the problem, and who's responsible for the problem, and who's not willing to take responsibility for it, and what's the guarantee for after-sales?
Five stars of good quality, bad logistics.
1 High quality, second-killing, moderate price, overvalued.
2 Solid, full, solid welding points, well-repaired surfaces and good colours.
3 Logistics is a hard wound, number 3 of the list, number 11 arrives.
4 If Amazon did not indicate that the expected arrival date was 7 February, I might be satisfied.
However, the indication of the expected time of arrival amounts to a commitment for the user, which is difficult when the promise cannot be honoured.
6 If you do not give any assurance about the commitment, do not make a commitment.
7 In fact, I care very much about the commitments made by the merchants.
Eight, so I got a low score.
The gold line will fade.
There are effects, but it's personal or psychological if it's obvious.
One thing that's not so good is the gold line, which was designed to look good, but in fact, the gold line turns black, puts it in the car, and if you pick it up a few times, in the hand, and in the car, there's some gold powder.
It is hoped that products can be improved.
The square doesn't have any decorative effect, so don't get the gold wire up there and fall down and get the car dirty.
Everything's in order. Speed's good. Two packages, different packages.
Eight days were fast, but two pieces were divided into two packages, and the packaging was different, and it was clear that one was too much anti-shock, the cardboard was stuck, the plastic was sealed and the overpack was easy to unbuff, and one was like a mail box in the country, with a few airbags in it.
Jalan's mattress is really good.
34CM mattresses are not usually thick, and no bed can sleep directly on mattresses.
It's good quality, both on the front and on the back. It's soft. Sleep is comfortable.
When the mattress was received, there were two stains on the delivery of violent couriers, and the Yalan passenger service was responsible and the efficient connection solved the problem.
It's not a self-employed commodity. The Amazon is shameless.
The page is clearly self-directed and is in fact distributed by the supplier, followed by the supplier, which makes its own contact with the supplier when the issue arises.
If you wish to cancel the order, I am sorry, the order information has been communicated to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you wish to return the order, you have successfully applied for it in the Amazon.
What kind of shit is this?
The merchandise is not a Amazon distribution, it's sold and the Amazon doesn't take it, and the guests say, "I'll help you reach out to the suppliers," and they claim to be self-employed, shameless, naked, naked, cheating on the consumer!
It's a depressing experience.
The filters that had been purchased on the other web sites had been good, and it had been used for another day or two after the end of the 28-day period.
Since the quality of what has been purchased in the Amazon has always been the same, this time I'm thinking of buying it here, buying it for the first time in the Amazon. It's not so good. Not only does it start with dirt early, but it's going to be used until the 28th day, and there's a little black powder floating. I don't know if it's going to go on or just throw it away. It's very depressing.
Not as good as I thought.
Compared to the plug boards I used in the past, outside work is common, and how it is not unopened internally, it is hoped that, as the shopkeeper has described, there is a lack of display of electricity per independent unit in terms of ease of use.
Packaging is broken and the quality of the product is tested in time.
The overpacks are badly broken and the boxes appear to be new, but the instructions don't seem to be new, they're only in September, they're in stock, and hopefully they won't be bad. Please explain to Amazon why several customers mention the damaged packagings, but you can live in peace. Thank you.
It's all good. It's a little bit of a problem.
For the first time, a filter canteen was purchased, several evaluation articles were read, and LAICA was selected for a higher value than it was, and received a copy of the instruction book containing the filter core, tested it, and it was generally good, but when the water was poured, it was as if the original water was mixed from the mouth of the pot with the treated water (the original reservoir was less sealed).
When you use it, you have to wait until all the water is filtered out!
Image incomplete
The picture does not capture the details of the side, which do not correspond to the style of the subject, which is one; the bead is from Thailand, which does not identify the origin, which is the second; it does not identify the texture, which is the third; and when I bought it in England, I identified each box, there was only one simple plastic bag, and there was no product sign on the bead, and where do I judge it to be true or false?
Buy carefully, especially from Hong Kong.
The Amazons are terrible.
Ordered two days ago, it was discovered that 40 dollars had been dropped today, that it took a lot of time to find a customer's service, that it was impossible to make up for the difference and that it could be repurchased and returned.
This client experience and service is 10,000 times less than that of a treasure.
Well, as a rookie, it's worth it.
It's not as good as Great Kong. I've seen the market price before. It's a few hundred, but it's the first time I've ever played Golden Kong.
It's good stuff.
It's really nice, it's for my girlfriend, it's just that I wasn't having a lot of fun at noon when I wasn't picking up a delivery. The logistics company sent me a certified text message in the mail deposit and it didn't send me a copy of it, causing me to run two times.
But the baby's really good.
Worth it.
The little monkey is so cute, the Amazon is so generous, the Xiaosheng Network delivers it directly, the day before yesterday night, and it's just this afternoon, that's fast.
The couriers are also responsible.
Yes!
A confession from a customer.
1 The Amazon Inn tells you don't worry. We'll be in touch with you in about 54 hours.
Then in the middle you contact the client service, they'll tell you that the matter will be handled by a commissioner, and he'll inform you of the outcome.
You never reached out to this commissioner, you don't know her job number, you don't have a direct call, you can't reach her, she's the only one who's in touch with you.
The tragedy was that after almost three days, the commissioner contacted me and my cell phone left for a while without receiving a call from the commissioner.
I waited two hours and didn't wait for the Commissioner's call, and during that time I contacted the Amazon customer service on my own initiative and mailed it to her to call me back.
Four days have passed and I don't even know what Amazon's gonna do with me getting this coffee machine!
American Amazon commodities are not problematic, and purchasing this kind of shopping abroad is good, but far less so than services to the Americas.
Six, for me, I'm just gonna have to wait...
It's not even.
Because it's good to see, all of them are looking forward to it, and they're very fond of it when they get their hands, and they're light, but when they open, they're not flat, they're in the middle, they're dim, they're in the surroundings, they're out of gas, they're out of gas, they're out of gas, they're out of gas, they're out of gas, they're out of gas, they're out of gas, they're out of boilers, they're not gonna be able to cook properly.
I don't know if I was lucky enough to get a flat pot, thanks to Amazon's offer of a month's return service.
I brushed it clean and clean, and I worked half a day in vain.
A good product design requires a matching manufacturing process.
It's a very simple design-style product.
The shape of the cube, and the designer handles the top into a tiny arc.
It's supposed to be a very fluid line.
Unfortunately, the ultimate effect has not been achieved.
Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel and the back top of the water box.
The radians on the top and the radians on the control panel were not consistent, and a high difference of up to 2 mm or so followed the consolidation.
Though it looks like a very small gap.
But it could be said to destroy the whole design feeling.
It's kind of sad about that product designer.
Looks like a beautiful product manager doesn't have the capacity to build such a standard product.
(Not too much to ask for after-sales lady's feedback, but when I heard it was true for all the individuals involved in the product, it wasn't the only one I bought that had a problem, and her unconscionable and demanding mood made me understand that it was not too high for beauty) 2019-7-7 water pumps had failed, had been repaired for a second time and had broken for two weeks after the first repairs.
It's a good offer. It's a sad Amazon break.
The baby's got a week to buy, and it's super warm.
The outside of the pot does not touch a single amount of heat, i.e. it can effectively protect the temperature from dissipation if it burns.
The air-conditioning room remained at a high temperature after one night.
The Amazon said that the anniversary had been a great deal of 320 concessions, and it was found that 249,289,299 people had all felt a sense of deception, but went to the supermarket and compared it with the various cards at the same price, and it was still far better to carry them with them in the future.
Vitamix 6300 Vitamins
We've been watching for a long time, and we've seen 6300 discounts in the United States of America, and we've got the same prices overseas in Central Asia, and we've got to do it.
On the second day of September, the delivery is expected to be 21 and the 12th will be here. It's almost 10 days ahead. It's fast!
It's not a big box, it's just Vitamix's original package, and Amazon's not afraid of falling over the ocean!
The machine looks new, it's fully equipped, it's the glass that shakes on the bottom seat, and I'm afraid to fly straight out of it!
Asked a friend with 5,200, and he described it as as loose as mine.
The randomly attached recipes are all in English, they're hard to read, and there's no Chinese on the Internet. It's a problem!
Buy a transformer as soon as you get the shipment. We'll be there in three days.
It's too small, it's no umbrella, it's just a piece of material.
It's not a big deal!
The second set of Totes, 1. This one has no umbrella.
Instead, the one that was bought in U.S.A. before was free of pressure for three people.
It doesn't feel good.
The first is that the boxes are not very solid, they are deformed with extra presses, the second is that the plating of the back is not working to prevent the scratching of the boxes, and the second is that the boxes are wrapped in a cloth, the place where the poles are drawn...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
PS: Wheels do feel good.
It's okay.
Advantages: This double shoulder bag is delicate and looks durable.
Weaknesses: The two-dimensional code on the card can't be cleared (what the hell) and the 15.6 inch notebook can't be left (a little longer) and the two-handbag zipper can be locked up without a lock for the buyer, which serves no purpose.
The whole thing's fine. I don't know if it's real or not.
The overall feeling is good, and without knowing if it's true or not, you can't judge it.
Documents with A4 surfaces can be filled with 80 pages thick, but box-like objects too thick and too hard (non-deformed) are estimated to be unfilled.
It's soft, it's more human, it's pretty good.
It's just that there's a little sandy eye at the bottom of this one. Don't you know if I'm a bad person or not?
You're too lazy to trade back and forth. I'm sick of it.
It's a four-star game. It's worth it.
ForRoyal Global Camera Backband Single Reverse Belt
The back belt was designed to be scientific, shoulder-done, functional, and the camera was fixed and protected by soft material on the chest, not by screws, as were other fast-shooters, and it was easy to remove photographs.
After the garbage.
I bought the piano a month and a half ago, missing a spare, informing Amazon about the number I sold, and after a number of communications, the spare parts have not yet been received. Ask me how efficient it is!
I think it's gonna be a lot harder to fix after that. Let's hope our friends get out of the way. It's too much!
It's a little defective. It's a good sound.
The head is defective, it's missing an angle, it feels like a piece of junk, and there's no gift, but the price is good, and the sound of the piano is good.
It's okay. First one.
It's been a long time, except for the bass.
It's not as perfect as it's supposed to be.
When I first bought it, there was something wrong, all the lights were blinking and it couldn't work.
He asked for a change of goods, which had been in Shanghai for three days and had not yet been delivered.
No phone calls were made to the ration.
The courier said they only had that contact.
Amazons can't find a place to complain.
No request was made, and in the event of a delay in delivery, there was no reason to delay delivery at my request — such a text message came.
What was the question of the transit later?
The very poor shopping experience, however, has begun to call into question the effectiveness of the Amazon logistics and control systems.
I don't think I can get it today either.
The labels are so sticky, they're not waterproof.
Although the bluetooth connection is easy, the printed contents are waterproof and there is no overcoat on the surface; and the labels are very sticky, they are useless for cable tags, they fall easily, and the friends who buy the cables need attention.
The pen is fine, but the package is too simple, a paper box, with no protective measures, and the box in which the pen is packed is glued with a large piece of translucent glue, which is torn off on the box.
That's six hundred dollars for something like this, and it's a disappointment about a shopping.
But the pen is fine.
I hope it'll be better on the packaging!
It's not as good as 925-25 if it's written.
Let's celebrate the daily delivery, the aviation, the speed, the service!
It's been 925-25, it's great, it's just 925-85, it's not in the quality of the pen, it's beautiful, it's because it's a bit heavy, it's not easy to write fast, it's a little twitched around the length of the lead core, and it's a personal opinion that 925-25 is better than 85.
That's why he became a masseuse in the Amazon.
It's super-favourable, and the kids don't like reading pens.
It was unsealed, tried to apply for a return, and came to pick it up free of charge.
That's awesome.
Refunds are not promoted, but such services are only available in China.
Hope not to be abused.
Later, the books were moved and bought here.
Headphones, murmurs.
This earpiece is a real piece of shit, and I don't know if there's something wrong with my ear, or if it's not as good as it used to be.
I bought a blue one at an easy time two years ago, and it was nice not to have a loud bass, and it took me over two years to buy another one. After all, it felt good.
And then there was this purple thing that looked good, and this one came up and it didn't feel right until it was opened today, and it was loud and low.
At first I thought it was the sound of the song that didn't come to mind, but then I heard it for half a day and I realized that the problem was serious, that it wasn't meddling, that it didn't sound as good as the one before me, and that it was a little murmur. Is this the only purple thing that I bought, or is it really not working?
Very poor evaluation, very disappointing.
You have to return it tomorrow during the day.
PS looks good.
The AV setup is complicated, the surface is rough and the heat is high.
It's gonna take a while to comment on it!
The German version of DN 1080, which was just launched on 14 August, is a poor ex-worker.
1. The front plate, the knobs are plastic.
2. Backboard audio input plugs, horn output ends are so poor that it is much better to find a 1000-2000 CD player.
3. The caps were thinner and my transformer was dimmed and had to be opened and recovered by hand, and the top cap and the front plate were loose.
4. The entire machine is focused on the transformer end and moved in an unwieldy manner.
It feels like the sony entry machine, that's the job, from Malaysia.
It's like Sonny's job in China is better than that of a pony.
5. The machine was heated and the two-channel cap used to view a film for about two hours had a hand touch of 40-50 °C, and it was not known whether the transformer was too heaty.
Now use more power on the switch, and this stupid transformer has an estimated 4KG.
Sony should be using active evasive silence fan in the machine, open the case and see only large aluminium plate evaporation fragments on the tube.

I didn't open it.
Battery's in use.
I'd love to dissect it and see what's inside it.
Later on, in the event of disappointment, it would be too bad to spend that much money; in the event of satisfaction, it would be difficult to put it up again.
Forget it, even if Sonny uses a good core.
As for the detailed description of electricity, the general view is that it is disillusioned.
I'm fine, I've been working in a cell phone factory for a long time, and I'm half a battery engineer, except I don't know the circuits.
I'm glad to see you.
I didn't know what I was going to do until I opened the bag and it felt good!
Finally, when I touched the headphones, I felt so soft and so good in quality that I couldn't wait to plug into the phone to turn on the qq music.
I'm shocked. It's a 3D stereo!
I've asked about 30 or so in the real-estate news store, but it's not a winning card, it's a mixed one, so say it's 27 bucks, but it's absolutely worth it!
The worst Internet acquisition experience ever.
After the purchase order of 28 September, the system indicated that the shipment had been made and that it had not been received until 12 October.
Asked about the status of the Amazon order, the seller did not provide the express order number and could not find out where the order was.
An e-mail was sent to the seller asking whether it would be possible to provide a courier number, and no response was received for two days.
Unable to do so, dialed the Amazon service, told the seller's cell phone number, and I called the storeman, called the phone a few times, told that the courier had lost a copy, and that I could be reissued immediately.
I'm particularly angry, but because of the need for computers, I didn't tell the seller much, just send it to me right away.
As a result, the next day I called and asked, did I send the shipment?
The seller said it wasn't till the afternoon.
I called again this afternoon, and the seller said it had to be delivered after 5 and 6 p.m., so when I called at 7 p.m., no one answered the call.
I called again the third morning. Did you send the mail?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said no. Tell me if I'm in a hurry to order from another house, or if I can wait, this afternoon.
I can't. I'm gonna have to wait a long time from the other house.
Just ask the sellers to deliver the goods as soon as possible.
I finally got a computer on October 16 after countless phone calls.
As to the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it's for someone else. Let's make some comments later.
It didn't work out a few times in the first six months. We're in bad contact now. Can you fix it?
Because there's a desktop, it's been bought a few times.
It's just a few times in the trip bag.
It has recently been discovered that the connection to the power supply is non-charged and that a few electrical chargers and wire connections need to be reached by hand and right.
We don't know if we can fix it now.
The Amazon is strongly advised to deactivate the EMS!
Commodities five stars, logistics one star, average three stars.
I don't know why Amazon's sending EMS.
The purchase order showed that the service was expected on the 20th, so the family waited three days at home!
From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why four or five days?
The 22nd morning logistics check finally arrived in Fuzhou and was ready to pick up the goods with pleasure, and as a result, at night, when any phone calls and text messages were confiscated, the logistics check was signed at noon, and it was shown that I signed the receipt.
I was shocked at the moment!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I wonder if life's a good thing!
After running to the collection point, they moved the computer back.
The specific reason for this is simply because the delivery brother turned the two singles upside down, so that it is not lost.
I strongly advise the Amazon not to use the EMS, and I'm sure I won't buy it again if Amazon used the EMS delivery.
It's not bad.
First of all, a few days after the purchase, the price fell, which was good, the value was good, the cpu and the card were good enough to cover the mainstream net and a considerable part of the large single machine, the heat was very good, but the screen was a little leaky (ops screen disease), the sound quality was bad, the hard disk was bad (suggesting yourself to spend some money plus solidity), the hardware was taken yesterday and tested without any problems, the Win8.1 was not very good, the proposal was improved to 10, the seller was quick to send and the queries were answered, and the next day the computer invoice arrived, which was good, but there was nothing.
By the way, don't go to a store called the E-Cool Digital Center.
Things are good. Platform bureaucrats are still good.
The hard drive is of excellent quality, has an absolutely high value, is cheaper than Hong Kong, and is absolutely recommended for purchase if it is not in a hurry and can tolerate logistics.
But what I have to say is that the Amazon platform bureaucrats are still, as I swore a few years ago that there was no improvement when I swore I would never use them, that you would never find the actual logistics, that the information would never arrive in a few weeks, that there would never be a complaint, that there was no bureaucrats!
You'll get the shipment in a few days or 10 days!
Logistics is not easy.
It's not only packed flat, but the electrical packaging is open and it doesn't know if there's a switch.
F.Y.I.
It has not yet been tested and has always relied on Philips, hoping that the battery will live longer than the others.
It's online, it's probably water-infecting, and there's no warranty.
Depressed!
I don't know how long it's gonna take to put on the freshener now.
I bought it for someone else to open it.
More than 300 machines require more than 100 taxes, and more than 600 are now more balanced.
When you get it, it looks like it's been ripped open, you take a picture, you open it, you open the cardboard, you're still damaged, you're worried it's someone else's back, you'll give it to your husband before the anniversary day. The machine has no electricity, there's no dirt in the knife, so don't go back too far!
It's not clear what's going to work or what's going to happen in the short term, like the previous evaluation.
It's an upward level in the sense of the experience.
It's almost a top-level electric, there's a lot of dental cleaning patterns, but very few people change them every day.
It's been six months without a problem. Every day, almost a Monday.
Brushing accessories are also cheap in Amazon.
App's a little hard to use. Besides changing the color, what other seemingly compatible issues are the cause of the overseas editions?
I'd like to learn how to do it.
The price is high.
Three or four times have been used.
1. Packaging is complete.
2. Use is very simple and washing is easy.
Three, it's totally DY's hair cut, saves money.
On balance, a very successful purchase.
It's fake.
Last time two bags were bought, two different versions, and the word on the lower left corner of the package was green, and one bag was not, and the white word was, and the cat and the cat ate and the cat had a diarrhea.
I don't know if Amazon's source is fake, or if it was switched by the staff at the time of the shipment.
I'll buy it again, and if it's still fake, I'm going to have to find out who you're dealing with.
It's a truncheon!
The Amazon picture was slashed, and it turned out to be slashed. Isn't that a lie?
It's not bad.
Cats like to eat, that's the point.
And it does work.
Tight, narrow, stomping, grinding backs.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but unfortunately this is too bad.
Add: Compared today with the previous UN series of shoes (shoes were thrown for use), the material is much worse than before, less resilient and less air-emitting than it used to be.
2. My ankles were not high and my thugs were about three centimetres forward at the top of my ankles.
3. Three pairs of clarks have been purchased overseas and only one pair is suitable.
It scared me to delete all the fun in the collector's folder.
Try rockport back. We can't just go to the ecco real estate store.
It's second-rate. It's not very well controlled.
First of all, it is worth noting that Prime purchased UPs overseas, which was received on the 31st and the 6th.
Shoes look much better in color than pictures, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is slightly larger, 25 feet is 10.5 W wide, and the upper foot is slightly loose, but usually it's easier to wear, and a pair of shoes is just right.
Second of all, this shoe control is really unconscionable, one of the soles of the shoe is broken, the other one has various scratches and a needle eye, and the shoe face and the bottom of the shoe are connected to the end of the shoe are misplaced with glue.
A little regret!
For 280 bucks of activity, it's quite cost-effective to buy Arthur, and, of course, there's a lower price for the commentary.
Now, what's good about shoes: they're light, they're good for running, they're good for running, they're not loose.
I usually wear 40 shoes and this time I buy 40.5 with probably one thumb in front of the shoe, but it doesn't matter.
These shoes are “narrow” and, although they still have a distance, they feel tight.
And on the other hand, shoes may not breathe well, but they're very hot now.
Squeeze your feet.
It's a good shoe job, first of all. It's worth it.
My feet are the standard ones, run-shoes uk7.5, eu41.5 and leather shoes uk6.5, and the Amazon's footsteps have also been bought, and there has never been any discomfort, but the ones I refer to in my comments, the number number one ukh7 and the length of the length of the length of the length of the length of the foot, but because the shoes are too thick and the pressure on the backs of the feet is heavy and the foot shoes are very hard, making the upper feet very difficult.
If your feet aren't particularly thin, you're not recommended for this.
If it had to be bought, it could be done with a new shoe pad, but it looked like the old shoe pad looked like it was high-quality, no need to be a pity.
It's a perfect shopping!
It is very satisfying, very popular, that Amazon purchases abroad are authentic, of good quality, of good quality, of good good value, of good comfort, of good after-sales, of good hospitality, of good manners, of patient and efficient handling of problems, of good concern, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality, of good quality.
Anyway, the whole family likes to buy hopping overseas in the Amazon!
It's definitely bad!
There's nothing to say about this agency and the Amazon.
In the future, it is important to be careful when buying electronics on Amazon.
It's been a long time, but it's time to come and spit.
It's less than 200 in winter seconds. It's useless to put it at home for a few months.
In spring, it was discovered that the handrings were not connected to each other, and both equipment instructions expressed support for each other, and it was later discovered that it was a matter of heart rate, as other equipment was still not connected.
Call Amazon, let me contact the agency, which asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After almost half a month, things were sent back as they were. Even the delivery box was the one I used when I sent it!
There's no response and no feedback and no test report!
Tell me if it's good or bad!
Call and ask, saying that sending it back means the equipment's okay, okay.
But I still can't make it, and the agency says, "That's not their problem."
I'm sorry. I'm too lazy to let you screw up for a $200 thing.
Serious shit's not on board.
Very bad.
The headband's good material.
Better than nike.
It's good to breathe.
Just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Are you trying to make fun of me?
It doesn't cover the sun at all.
The reason why they don't return is because it works well as a headband.
Wear it up though it won't cover the sun.
But it's different from the other headbands.
Keep it.
Commodities were of good quality, Amazons lacked the spirit of contract, and deliverers were good.
I asked for delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon regulations do not allow delivery on Saturdays and Sundays.
I've been driving back 200 kilometers to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The deliveryer was very active and passionate.
Give it to me!
Commodities, a simple test, not bad.
But I've never bought anything like it before. I can't afford it!
The size, the logistics.
It's okay to work, it's too slow, it's all DHL, it's just that Apex bought a lot of UAs in the country, it's not cheap, it feels like it's higher than NICKE ADIDAS?
Actually, it's all the same okay, so seafood.
Rule size: I'm 176CM, 68 KG, my shoulders are 180, I buy M, it's a little bit long, the others are just right.
It's the right size.
The bra was 99, the height of 184 and the weight of 84 kg. Before the purchase, the customers were advised that they should buy xxl, and then looked at the review of the decisive entry L, which was found to be of the right size and almost buried when the goods were received.
The price of a double 11 is much higher than the price of a black five.
The clothes are very good in quality.
There's trouble with Z's merchandise problems!
On the 18th, it's only been received on 25th, the speed of Guangzhou to Beijing snail!
It's a Z-beneficial commodity, and the note says there's a scratch, but after receiving it, four screws and screws are missing!
The kid doesn't want to return the goods, he doesn't think it's a big problem, but the little parts, the spare parts, he ran away from a few hardware stores around here!
Finally, Grandpa's sticky!
Looks like we won't be able to buy any more Z-based goods!
The quality of the toys is not good.
Most of the bolts are not aligned, they are laborious, they are of poor processing quality and they do not know how long they can be played, because they are promised to the child and they do not go back.
In other comments, it's easy to install. Is there a problem with this one that I bought?
It's normal.
Is it my bad luck?
Packaging is too old; the work is very common; the music has only one and only eight seconds of length and then repeats repeatedly; and the movement is to shake the head from the way forward without any change.
It's not worth the price.
If it's urgent, I won't return it.
The toy's good quality. Let's go for it.
I got a delivery yesterday, from Amazon, marked with EMS, and finally from Skycat. How many turns was it? How good is Amazon and Skycat?
Once again, packaging is covered with a couple of layers, not even a packaged plastic bubble paper, and when you open it, all the parts are in an empty box. It's good toy quality, there are no broken parts, it's much smaller than you think, because it's not battery, it's often deorbited, and it feels like there's too much space on both sides of the orbit and it's not rationally designed.
It's good quality. It's fun.
It's fun. The components are very precise, they're very sophisticated, they're of similar quality to Lego, and they're very inexpensive.
It's an interesting process. I'll do it. Five-year-old son. Good.
He'll probably buy this brand toy later on.
It's new. It's nice.
I've seen it for Christmas. I've bought 150 bucks, but it's a little slower.
The machine's good. It's new.
The built-in pika mound.
And then you get a dream when you connect to the elf ball.
It's not bad, it's better than ps4, it's more portable.
We've bought Zelda, wait for the game and try again.
The production of bad goods and the sale of bad goods resulted in the purchase of six watches for the delivery of children, the quick figures of which were incomplete, and the hours of the six were inconsistent, ranging from 10 hours to 10 hours.
I asked the manufacturer if there was time to check the watch in the store. They said, "Yes," and if there was, why there was so much difference in time, it must have been an inaccuracy of the watch, simply water products, not what I said. Look, the obvious quality problems (the numbers show incomplete) are all sold, whether they're junk.
I contacted the seller, the seller gave a lot of reasons and complained that they shouldn't have bought their stuff, products like that, after-sales services like that, and who would buy anything on Amazon later.
Anyway, I don't want to buy anything from this seller. It's garbage.
Amazon issue.
Upon receipt of the shipment, the inspection found that:
1. The packaging of the tables is seriously worn out.
2. The table of contents contains a serious use of wrinkles.
Tables are not taken and lamps are not charged and cannot be time-adjusted.
4- Separate contact with the Amazon passenger service, which can only be mailed to the United States at its own expense, followed by supplemental postage.
The reason for the difference between 5 and 2 is that the customer service is still good.
All I can say is it's all right.
Time is not very precise, it is about one second a day, and it has been almost two minutes in just a few months.
I've used a West Iron City before, and it doesn't feel like it's a couple of seconds away for a year or two.
The 10,000-year-olds function well, with a little bit of a timer function, which is hardly needed, and occasionally by accident into the timer mode.
Solar sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging does not have to worry about changing batteries, world time, multiple alarms and full alarms.
Deficiencies: mirrors are easily scratched and dusted.
Prices: The average domestic price is between 220 and 300, with more than 180 purchases abroad (about one week).
It's a very satisfactory watch.
It must be the real thing. It's a good look. It's a good look. It's a good look, and it's a good fit, and it's also an imported mechanical core, so it's a bit of weight, and it's not comparable to the 300 or 400 so-called machines, and this is real.
The tables were carried with precision, the error was entirely acceptable, the forms contained jewellery identification certificates in the packaging, the 12 words on the tableboard were real diamonds, which were well-dressed and presented as gifts.
The Bentley watch is really good.
The worst shopping ever.
During the night of 23 September, the wife fell on her cell phone, and there was an eight-p order from the fast-growing Malay Amazon, which was not self-employed and for which there was no increase in prices (the system showed that the latest delivery was expected to take place on 27 September, owing to the slowness of the delivery of non-self-employed goods.
The wife, who had no cell phone, asked me to do something about it the following morning at 6 a.m. and then went to Kyoto to see that 256G could be delivered on the same day, only to order one more immediately.
When the new one's ready, you'll have to cancel the Amazon's order right away.
Since the order was in the middle of the night, it was not possible to pick up the delivery in the morning, and more than 7 p.m. called the customer service to request cancellation of the order, and the response to the order was cancelled.
All right, I'll wait patiently. When I get on the phone at noon and the order's still on hold, I immediately ask for the order to be cancelled, and the customer's response is operational.
At 3 p.m., the order is still on. We can't just contact the customer's service again. Please cancel the order and tell the seller not to deliver the order!
At my request, the services contacted the seller on the spot and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and had to wait until it became familiar with the system before the order was cancelled.
But tell me clearly that the seller knows and will never deliver.
When I look at the order on Monday, it's already been delivered, and I don't know what to say.
Since it was not possible to contact the seller directly, it was possible to call the customers again.
The rest of the process is so quiet, it's basically a step I'm going to take, and I'm going to go back to the service.
The order has so far been rejected and ready to be sent again!
Isn't Amazon going to follow up?
It doesn't matter if the selling company takes the money and doesn't follow up.
To sum up, the big one will never be paid in advance. It's too much trouble.
It looks beautiful.
This camera was seen a long time ago, but it was not purchased for reasons other than the price, and this time it was bought because the price was still available.
There's nothing wrong with the rest of the purchase: when the software is connected, it's not even connected. My house is a TP router, it's a problem for a lot of people, it's been on the Internet for more than two hours, it's a variety of rerouting devices, and I used 360 WIFI as a medium to make the calls, and there's nothing they can do about it, so let me just contact Amazon for sale.
It is also worth noting that I saw the user's comment online that this camera supports a minimum of 8G storage cards and that the smaller storage capacity cannot be identified, and I hope you will be aware of that.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, but the sound is bad, the machine has a certain amount of heat, and it's kind of hard to feel that level of heat.
In the light of the foregoing, there are many shortcomings in this product, and we hope that it will be bought with caution.
The three stars were given because they were bought by the first love of life for almost three years, so they left me last year, until now.
The reason for the three stars is because it's bought with the first love of life. I don't know how much it's used. Maybe throw it away!
After almost three years of dating, he left me last year, and now thinking of her, he wants to leave the world, and the first woman in her life brings me the shadow and the heartache of my life, and has not yet been able to come out.
When you buy this phone, think of the two who felt like they were still together, but now they're sad. Maybe that's what life is like. Some people don't want to see it all their lives, and some things don't want to know, but what do they do?
Every time I saw Sam's phone, I thought of her, and the pain filled my whole body with it, and I never gave up more than $2,000 in cell phones, but when I bought her, I didn't hesitate to be nice to someone, but one day when she changed her heart, all the mountain vows went away.
It's a fine piece of a national product plate.
It's a fine piece of national goods.
Low-key generals and businesses, with technology and quality to win their clients, are completely different from the current business culture of advertising to raise visibility!
There's no way a company without power can do this. It's not going to do this!
That's why I chose Hua Xuan.
It's been over six months. It's always been good. It's really good.
The reason for not giving the full score was because, on one occasion, when navigation was offline, there was a lack of location, and I finally didn't find out why, and it was all good at other times.
And it's online, it's got a destination, it's automatically designed, it's offwifi, it's functional, it doesn't have to run traffic, it's talking directly to the satellite for location and navigation. That's great!
Sony's great.
Sony's low-end machine is still well designed and cheap, has a big screen, has a first-strength continuation and is suitable for the elderly.
Although the time has passed for a long time, the machine remains intact.
But because my Z2 has been decentralized, this cell phone has also completed its mission.
I don't think so.
