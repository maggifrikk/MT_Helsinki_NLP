I know how to cook, the main thing is to make a recipe, but I like baking.
Ukraine has traditional borsch, pans, and others.
I don't have my favorite food, and I like to try different dishes from different countries.
What do you like about food? Do you like cooking?

Green: Mariopolis's heart of war, will stop fighting
President Vladimir Greenski believes that fighting west of Ukraine and especially under Mariopolis will determine the course of war and if the ZSU is defeated there, the Russians can abandon the negotiations and recapture the deoccupied territories.
The direct language is, you know, Mariopolis is the heart of this war today.
It's going to be defined by us as we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have more weak positions.
They are the people who have pulled away a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariopolis, the stronger our position will be in the east, in the (rion) OS, and if they'll be stronger, then the table of requisition will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is going to be weak in all these directions, we can never wait to meet.
Because then Russia is going to do all these steps that can lead to returning even to the cities that we've already mobilized.
They may also go to that.
Then our situation in the negotiations would be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we're stable.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory..."
Greenman also said it's hard to negotiate after the Ukrainian torture, but "we should not miss out on diplomatic solutions if we have them."
The direct language is, "People will take peace anyway, because people want it to end.
In our context, Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something, and I don't think it's going to satisfy any peace at all.
But if we don't speak emotionally, war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of victims.
And even where the million victims are, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight? But for life's sake.
You can't fight for dust, when there's nothing, there's no man."
Hello, do you have any more room for an adult Czech course from 7 p.m. on Tuesday?
If you'd like, you can meet your family in the Kutney Mountain.

Because of the change in Ukrainian literature aesthetics, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality.
It's the analysis of the metaphoral space of Ukrainian literature, of the state study.

Don't translate the subject I'm asking you directly if you want to keep talking to me if you don't write to me already.
Anyway, we're going to work and we're going to waste money.
We'll have a leader on Monday, and we'll decide how and when we'll do it.
Good, 'cause I'm starting to think that I've got the wrong idea and I didn't get the wrong idea.
I think it's a good decision, it's better to give these people quality help than when a lot of people do.

But if you don't want to talk to me, I miss you.
Why did you believe you didn't need that kind of experience?
Every situation is given for something.
Usually, changes are needed, especially in a spiritual way.
I'll give you this money, as the bank will approve.
About $30,000 on debt, which you have plus $30,000 to keep.
Janka, I hope you're OK, and your grandmother won't call me bad words.

The chief intelligence officer of Ukraine's Defense Department published a list of Russian military personnel involved in the war crimes in the Kyiv region.
According to Uckinform, this is the main Intelligence Office of the Ministry of Defense reports on Facebook.
‚ñ° Every Ukrainian should know their names!
GURI MO Ukraine obtained a list of 64 separate mobile - gun crews directly involved in military crime against the people of Ukraine in Buchaa, which is the report.
HUGE MOU notes that for the crimes committed against Ukraine's peaceful population, all war criminals will be tried and held accountable.
The list can be viewed by reference.
According to Uckinform, Irrein, Bush, Gostiel, and the whole Kyiv region were freed from Russian invaders.
Freed cities and villages have records of mass killings by Russian civilians.
On April 1, Bushie's head, Anatolys Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in their brother's graves.
On April 3 of the Russian invaders in the territory of the Kyiv region, 410 bodies of civilians were taken away.
February 24th, the president of the stateway announced the beginning of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders are being shot and destroyed by key infrastructures, mass - mass - fired round areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, global - fire jets, ballistic missiles, and airbom.
Hello, I'm sorry, but I can't work with you because I'm about to fly to Canada.
Right at the foot are the regular names; at the stroke are the flat expressions; in the brackets are the abbreviations used for the hour schedule.
I don't want to bother you, relax.
I watched the weather forecast. It'll be cold.
I don't need any brands.
It's just good clothes with normal prices and size.
We were at the store at the train station.
Jobs that offer, possible without language knowledge?
It's important if there's such a tradition, I need to know if I'm going to prepare.
I thought a week later, but we're on fire.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the road.
I thank everyone for the experience, even if it's painful.
I think I've learned from every situation for myself so as not to make mistakes.
The directives are made in the form of numbered written additions that are part of this Reglament.
I'm sure there won't be a problem with that.
Many people in Ukraine also celebrate this week.
It depends on the religion.
Whether a man is Greek or Catholic.
at first, it's free of charge.
Maybe you'll pay us all the way, we'll pay ourselves.
We have the paper that kids get at the end of school year, and they get their certificate born and married.
He's on it as an expert driver, but I don't know if it's better.
They say we have to fill out, write, in Czech...
I'll see if I can make it, 'cause I've got to go to town, sign the papers.
My wife's not angry you're on the phone.
In my daily prayers I thank God and the Mother of God for you.
May they embrace you with their cover of love and warmth last night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
place, day and time will be clarified according to interests and opportunities
We promised that if you went to school, we'd bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have the money for two months rent, the neighborhood in Olmooka doesn't matter, I'll thank you very much.
Most of my acquaintances are shocked by the news of beastly abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot men confused the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how it could have happened in the 21st century?
I wasn't surprised at what I was looking for with sadness.
I took my children and my elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls came back to work with the kids, and only then did they go back to the capital.
Since 2014, I have been able to help with the ECU, and I have no doubt for a moment that in the case of Kiev's premeditation, my family will not be saved.
Because I was and I am absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it just can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937 one of my great - grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zytomir.
A few years ago, a copy of a gunman was taken from the U.S.S.U.'S.U.'S.U.'S.U.'S.A.'S.U., and he was given a copy of the B.C.S.A., and he was right over a hundred pages, and the execution sentence was very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, and the guilt was denied.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor "one-way," never walked in the cogs.
That fact, which lived in the hamsters and had several cows, was sufficient to condemn the leopard and the farmer of young children to death.
The relatives did not even know where the burial place was located.
Grandma said that about a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all except two who agreed to give a false witness.
There's the name of Sharius in the prison case.
Our former Supreme Council speaker comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his cousin was a KGB informant.
The apple is not far from the tree, it is known to fall...
The gun - fired three that condemned the execution of peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the matter of the great - grandfather, I was intrigued by various information resources.
There's some wonderful information resources out there, like the Death Barak, that are very good at reminding us of what's going on in those years.
Now, in today's growth, the offspring of the NCVD found ways to punish and eliminate almost all of those who had seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 or 80 years ago.
People who found mass victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of murderers were first discredited and then destroyed.
It was like they found kids' pornography files on the computer, they put them in jail, and they died pretty soon there.
The KGB are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why do you suddenly wonder what they're doing now?
It focuses on the most nasty features of human nature.
The peak of the thousand - year - old ordinian tradition was slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then what came out was a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the half-French movie "The Checist" in 1992, and that's what happened.
So you've seen my pictures in the bathing suit.
Or you can ask your wife what I can buy by coughing.
I'm sorry because I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids are going because Galia can't identify them.
Do you think Igor wants to know if it's convenient for you to go tomorrow? - He's off and he can go because the car hasn't looked at the station yet.
We're very uncomfortable to bother you so much.
You're helping us so much, thank you!
‚ñ™ The bodies of 7 civilians were found in Borodyaca, Kiev, as a reference to the collapses of two multistory apartment buildings.
‚ñ™ The Protectors of Marioupol declared it a spray over the city of an unknown poisonous substance from a Russian drone.
Three people suffered.
In Russian prisons about 1700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held.
Among them are ‚Üë500 women.
‚ñ° Germany will set aside 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court investigating the war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
‚ñ™ Canada has set up sanctions on 33 companies in the defense sector.
‚ñ™ In recent times, fighting in eastern Ukraine destroyed one enemy tank, three armored transporters, three artillery systems, 24 units of automobile technology, one helicopter, and three drones.
Your coffee's on its way.)
I've got my first bicycle after my son.
When girls come back from school, what do they do later?
We came to the place where they put us from the center at the Pardubice, the conditions were good.
But there's a big one, but there's men like drinking alcohol and smoking around, loud music that's the smallest thing that's gotten upset, smell of smoke drunk men, and we and the kids... it's scary to go to bed, to be honest.
Please help with the house over the money.
But in places where it's safe and non-smoking.
The smell of cigarettes in this room is not bad enough, it's just smokes.
I beg you very much, one of them barely stands on his feet, something shouts, something he doesn't like.
I'm just praying if you can help.
The main thing is that we understood each other.
Very positive, such a beautiful garden, such pleasant educators.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, thank you very much.
On a good evening, St√©phanie, the Agata wants to participate, she misses her game....

How do I get to the apartment today to clean up?
If I'm at the main entrance, I'll let you know and you'll open up?
I wanted some more if I could take a look at Carina's cake somewhere.
I forgot to write you, I'm sorry.
Everything went very well yesterday.
We talked about children in particular need of you and their learning system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shahowa introduced me as a Fpointer, the first question was how a dog was found when a mob was found.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
I've asked them to give you their regards and tell you that it's very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about the monastic people they have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child came and the parents didn't understand Czech at all, then after work I could help them in phone mode.
I need to change bed linen, two sets.
It's just on holiday days that I'm happy with.

That's how it's been at Nestor's grave yet, and Galica has a temperature of 37.7 dinners of 38.
It's a very slow turn for General Chapeek.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is genuine and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people enter marriage for various reasons, mostly self-interesting, mercenary purposes.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love a man, it won't work.
Yes, we took them home and drove them home right away.
She was so grateful that she cried.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it could be some old blanket and pillow.
But I don't have to say that, but if I do, I'm grateful to you, too.
I certainly felt sorry for him.
He killed my best friend.
I had many questions about God, why there were situations in my life that forced me to give up everything.
Do little grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made a meeting.
That's right, but we don't know where it is yet, and we don't know where it is. We're looking today for an hour and we're going back on foot. The two worlds are not fit, so the two and the big ones are needed.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Can your father only speak Russian or any other family?
You can have kids come to Vala and play in the lobby.
All right, well, let's take a chance.)
I'm glad I met you, too.

But I can't call him because I ran out of money.
I can't get my phone back because I don't understand Czech online banking and I don't get any money from my Ukrainian bank card.

I'll write to you anyway.

It's fun to talk to you, and I even like it.......
I went to the caritas, and they offered me a room for a week or two, but I need a permanent home where I could be with the baby, and why it's going to be less and less.
The flowers fell. It's okay. Everyone's rested and very beautiful.
According to European Truth, Welt writes about this with a reference to sources in the government's circles.
According to the publication, the right offer was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 wallets, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
It is also suggested that wallets be available for 1.2 billion euros.
While battle tanks have to climb relatively close to the target, Panzeerhaubze 2000 can fire more than 20 miles [30 km] away.
According to Ukrainian government circles, links to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-driving wallets will follow a circular pattern.
Bundesover will give Kiev 100 of its duets in the shortest terms, and the gaps that have been formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new wallets may be signed 30 months after the contract was signed - before the latter half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Are we the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?
Thank you.

A man and a woman decide for themselves in their family, especially if they have no family.

I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, my love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I feel like we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there's a lot of work to be done after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I don't know what's going to happen to the house.
I need to be tested for a food license. Can I do it with you?
Please tell me to make an apartment tomorrow for 5 guests.
Do I understand the place in the room with the TV?
Laying and putting on the couch?
Can we stop at you while Mrs. Margaret finds us a home?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that was already being used, but the job isn't necessary.

Because I'm worried everything's going well!
Because we haven't even talked about this with excarcation!
I understand how important that is to you!
And I'm not saying anything about myself, for me, it's just the top that I don't know!
How do you feel today?
Hey, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Kol and I had trouble translating the test yesterday.
I'm going to ask whether Gregory Denissen or not to help me with my math.
Maybe I could be something useful for them, too.
If there's a possibility, I want to pick up mathematical terms in the weekend.
Geometry's complicated at all, but it's got to work out with Kolya so that there's no mistakes.
Thank you for your test work
That's what we're hoping for, too.
And she's really excited about any gift she's got.
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
I met Victoria, Ukraine, at the 402 bus stop yesterday.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I wasn't able to keep my distance.
Now we agreed that we would be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because she's the first person I've ever met in Ukraine.
The Department of Room No. 29 is specifically designed to deliver and process applications for help
Turns out I ordered a spare card.
Don't, I'm a simple man.
Don't scare her that nobody's coming.
That's what I can do, what you taught me how to turn the oven on.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Holocaust Memorial in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Baba Yara.
I had the privilege of serving after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their course and life in territorial unity, peace and security of Europe.
We have to protect this base, and this is also part of our responsibility, which is related to our history.
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes, " ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î he said, for us Germans, there may be only one answer: never again!
The fight has to go on."
Today Russia attacks a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of its blocked cities, and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops are firing massive shots of Ukrainians, even as if visually they were shooting at Baba Yara.
For over a month, the Germans see this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany does the sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, and also provides weapons that not long ago were impossible.
Germany is lagging off the heavy arms delivery required by Ukraine.
But, "Never again!" means more than going against the swastika.
It means fighting every means possible against mass murder, genocide, war crime, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims of overcoming evil and stopping the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One for you at night
We agree, get on a tour, and write it down when we're together.
They all had only Lydia's disease. They had an amicron of a new kind.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm using that tank instead of brown.
Vote for your late papers.
A hook cost me 2,000 shits as a guide.
Our membership in NATO ceased to be a long prospect.
9 years ago, Ukrainian socialism showed that 67 percent of Ukrainians were against the introduction to NATO and only 18 percent of those interviewed said "for."
After the Hydnasty Revolution, the escapes of Victor Januskov, the Crimean anexia, and the beginning of the war of Donbass, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, and the adherents, instead, grew.
After the beginning of the full - scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's entrance to NATO among Ukrainian citizens over 75 percent.
Despite supporting Ukraine's introduction to Nato and the help that Nato is carrying out in the war, there is now a lot of criticism about the Allies and the member states of Russia for the not-to-time arms supply, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "spare" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire for membership in Alain because of RF, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will have secure security, including the military.
In a new episode of the Counting Questions, together with the editor of the European Truth, we've been talking about how it has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, why Nato should be critical, and why Alliance is being criticized in vain, why our prospects of membership in NATO are closer than ever before, and why the security guarantees that are discussed in the negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapestic memorandum.
What do you think is here?
I've got my partner on the volt that my Invocation on the review.
I gave it to her because of this mobile app.
No visas, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because they put it in Poland, they didn't give it to us, they gave it to us.
We'll write it for you!
I went to see Denise in a good mood today.
Arrangements were made for a boy from Ukraine who met yesterday to meet at the school to show him the whole thing.
So I hope he's doing well.
Because this is the way I don't love, I'm short of it for a long time.
Ukraine reports that the Czech Republic has sent tanks to Ukraine, T-72, and infantry cars.
I'm leaving the kids I'm waiting out there for 3-4 years and going home because I can't leave any more.
And the brothers are with them at 6-7 a.m. in the morning.
Yes, there was a heart condition.
I had a genuine feeling for him, but he did not do so well and I left him.
In time, he returned and apologized.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he phoned for heart surgery.
He asked me to just talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I was psychologically supportive of him for almost half a year.
During that time we talked a lot.
I started having problems on my job in parallel.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe I really should take a different look at it.
And he asked me to marry him, and two days later he died.
So God himself has decided our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks Czech.
I just wanted to say I've managed to find a place to live, and I'm very happy to know that I have a place to live now and have a place to live with my baby.
You should've remembered me before?
) Because I helped see the children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write them that don't understand the sentences.
I realize for myself that the translator does not always translate the text correctly
I don't know how to talk to the doctor or should the paper be given?
I must've forgotten the guests. I put them in the closet.
It's probably time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Can anyone help a woman with the size of XS or S, the height of 165. And also for her daughters (8, 10.12 years) Thank you.
This time in the ice, I bought two packs and Mom bought two.
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, talk about something else, I'm still awake, I'm still falling asleep, and I'm dreaming of bombing...
God is never late, always his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand perfectly well the price of unskilled labor, and I realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I won't be able to have here and the money I made at home, but I won't get it right now.
But just sit there and don't do anything. I can't do anything, because then all the bad thoughts in my head, so I have to do something physically.
There's code at the airport from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.; otherwise you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4: 00 a.m.
So we took them home.
Vica and I slept in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.

'Cause I can't find a place for myself.
Sir, these are Ukrainian kids joining the gymnasium.
Yes, but I'm making it difficult.
Okay, write to me when it's convenient.
I don't know what I'd like if I had kids in kindergarten and school.
That's what we planned to do.
I'm sorry, I really don't have any missed calls from Wednesday.
I suggest work, bathroom and toilet cleaning, washing three windows, cleaning dust.
Work is around 3-4 hours, 800grans per hour, from 1904 Tuesday, from 2:00 p.m.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're good.
Can I call you?
Or can you write down your wife's contact?
The crack started coughing, I want to ask what I could buy in the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
We think of Anna as our original name.
She got an uncle from home.
English was made, new partners added
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget about me, please don't forget me.
Is school different on Monday and Wednesday?
Thank you very much, you are doing so much for our family!
To be in a swimming pool, you need help.
But that's my opinion.
From home, my uncle gave her rollerblades and a torture board, and she was riding them at home, so it does.
I also got up at 9 o'clock, and just now I'm making breakfast.
I'm very ashamed that you're talking to me on your day off, and I hope I'm not very annoying.
We want to report the change of the house and file documents for the card extension.
We're now sending medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you tomorrow's snack.
One mother said that the kids have jam donuts for jam kids.
He comes to see you.
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule for cleaning your apartment a month ahead, even though for a approximate understanding of what days it is?
I can't remember that schedule.
Russian armies threaten to strike Kiev with missiles saying, "They didn't do this before."
Conachenkov's direct language: "We see attempts at diversium and targeting the Ukrainian troops at effigies in the RF area.
If that happens, then the RF forces will hit the centers of decision-making, including in Kiev, which the Russian army had held on to before."
The Russians have struck Kiev since the first days of full - scale invasion of the invading RF forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian rockets that hit Ukraine's PPO system fell on an apartment building on the capital's Pharmacies.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a cross-floor on Valerious Lobova's Avenue.
On March 1 the Russians hit the television in the Highlander near Baba Yara, killing 5 passersby.
On March 2, Ukraine's PC systems hit the Southern Railroad Station with Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Defense Department building.
On March 14 the wrecks of the invading missile smashed the house and the trolleybus in Kurevica, Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residence site on a cultivator, killing another person, and 19 others were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets were completely destroyed by the modern Retrovile TAC, which killed at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klechko, stated again on April 13, that the residents of the capital, who were evacuated from the city, are not yet ready to return.
The army explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still use missiles in Kiev and that there were many mines and unrivaled ammunition in the suburbs of the capital.
On April 12, Ukraine's Department of Defense warned that the Russians were planning a series of terrorist attacks in the RF area to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army in regard to civilians.
On April 1, at Belgorod, in Russia, an explosion of nattobaza was said to be the result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, Belgorod's local authorities claimed that a Ukrainian projectile had fallen near the city.
Apparently both the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing a cold sweat at the thought of Russian bombers shooting down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Greenski doesn't talk to them as much as to their voters and societies in general.
By their talks in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors were able to do.
The greens don't persuade European politicians to do anything for Ukraine, they argue about the European people who choose them.
And these talks, this elegant alloy of power, of emotion and of time of despair, gradually reach their goal.
While that Bayden guy is flatly against the close of the sky, 70 percent of his fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to the speeding up of Ukraine, this process is on its way.
I understand you, so I don't want you to think we're frauds.
The money you collect is better given to people who need it more.
I can come to your house and decide where you're going, and I'm going to help you anyway.
But the air is clear, that's plus.
It says that I have a two-off flight, and I asked for the Internet to be done.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have any more room today, as usual, just a climb up from the top down?
So I'm on my way to see that you're a train.
But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Kate asked for the Internet, can I give her a password?
I thought you and Milan weren't shooting each other.
Great, then my husband will drive me because he's got a car from the construction company where he works for today.
How happy and thankful we are that our Nick and grandchildren are protected by you!
Thank you so much for the invitation!
We also hope that we will be able to invite you to Ukraine after the war!

One of these particles can be used for two or three days, but brush every hour

It's probably at 4:20 p.m. the concert starts at 6 and then I'm free again.

Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write to me today... something.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely, today I only ask for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I'm asking you to be patient with me.
Are you okay with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, go shopping, go on vacation.
You have dreams.
You plan to buy that dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your mozog can't take it.
He's squirming for the old reality.
You're calling to work, to find out if you're going to work today.
You decide to leave your children at home.
As long as it makes sense.
There's hope... it's not for long.
We'll... we'll make a deal... something will happen.
Mozog refuses to accept...
I don't have anybody and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket.
A lot of people in the hopes of leaders have been denied wages in our jobs.
Where am I going? Who needs me? How am I supposed to get the kids? Where am I going to live?
You don't have the chance to take many things.
You didn't take anything from home... you drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning till evening, you're dragging the kids all over Prague.
The kids are asking for candy, and you can't.
And from every advantage, we don't have that.
We have a choice of staying there and trying to put the kids in danger, or trying to save themselves here.
She was very happy with the hearts and the things the kids gave her when she came to school.
I should have called me when you came.
I'll write to you at dinner.
Yes, I believe in God and I trust him in my life
I can't do this anymore.
I thought you were in love with some Ukrainian girl and you didn't have time to talk.
I've even ordered it from the menu.
2. Would you like to join your Czech neighbors, your friends, your community?
If so, which kind of species.
Please send a page with a visa or a traveling seal (red with a date).
Without a refugee visa, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libusz, did you pay for the barley?
Because I can't understand.
You're doing us so much good...
We owe you so much... thank you!
Yeah, I know it's very good.
I'm going to give you a picture of a lady's card that I'm learning English.
Well, what you're gonna write tomorrow, whether we'll see you or not, maybe your plans will change...

What services/activity do you think the elderly need?

Then please write to me as soon as you're on your way
Today we have the joy of our city of Bush freeing our troops.
He's cleaning up the enemy and he's looking for Russians in basements and apartments.
The whole city is being replaced, the mine is starting.
And John would look, maybe there's something there that needs to be fixed or something to be done.
Maybe he'll be embarrassed, I don't know.
Our panas wants to stay at home, says he's tired of us, and wants to be alone when we're gone without him.
We're going to cook the Masuren and do the lessons.
These are small entrepreneurs who in their homes and shops have opened volunteer offices.
These are tractors that are actually being fired out into the field because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who are willing to go to the rubber shops today to take relief supplies and take people from there.
They are heroic leaders who ride unafraidly to combat zones, who calm and help refugees in cars, and at peace stations they help volunteers load the humanearies into cars.
These were gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyrical route in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
It is a public service that carries garbage under fire, and it has been designed to keep people wells and power lines clean.
They are doctors and nurses who, 24 hours a day, save people without complaining about anything, and they'll volunteer their first free minute to get a first aid kit to the front.
In Ukraine we have no juice when we have little leaves.
Please tell me, little kids -- what age do you mean?
My daughter's eight years old, is this age acceptable?
I'm looking for an apartment for my daughter and me for three-four days to come to Czechia and pass my visa passports to Canada.
There are a lot of people in Warsaw at the mall and they don't work on-line.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it takes a long time to travel, it's going to be hard for a child.
So I decided to search for or near Prague for accommodations.
No, we're fine.
Yesterday's Toolbox

I want to go and hug you, and I want to kiss you.
At 7: 30 a.m., I read the history of the world theater to actors, directors, and theater scientists.
I appreciate things tonight. You know, after dinner,
The dirt's still sleeping, crying hard at night, brushing her tooth.
I'm on the phone with all the people I know in Lviv, and a lot of people have died.
The Czech Republic began publishing visas after March 22, according to mine.
Up until then - images like this were set up and then leveled those to a visa
The border electoral district of Ukraine (WOS) (IBS) is the electoral district that unites the electoral districts located outside Ukraine, and consists of a votement in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and military bases abroad, [unique 1] where the Ukrainian peacekeepers of contingents (Cosco and DR Congo) are located. [1] the role of the regional electoral panel for the Foreign Council is run by the Central Choice Commission.

Are you mad at me?
I'll go to the remove photo in the pool.
I don't need any more money from a long-term friend.
I was about to say that I already had a Czech cell phone number.
I didn't need another device to do that, so I went to the O2 operator, and they made me an electronic SIM map, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable. Sunday's working and I can't do it anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have the blankets, we don't have the poppy blankets, we don't have the dishes. The kids don't have pajamas and we don't have anything to put on.
Morning, 10 o'clock, I'll be leaving. Write another address.

Do you have a meatbox to make a stew? We have one, but it doesn't work.

I went to school today, too.
Today I saw Kristina's mother, but she didn't even say hello.
Very tasty apples, what kind is that?
The head of the Office of President Andrey Jarmak announced that Russia was beginning a "feike weapon" on which the allies were giving us.
Yerman's direct speech is, "They know they're losing the war, they're seeing their distance, and they're trying to knock down the supply of arms by any means.
For example, one of the last fairies is the massive destruction of access to Slovakia's CRC-300.
This information has been refuted by Premier Edward Heger.
What's going to happen next is we know the Russian scenarios, we're going to name one of them.
They can launch fairies that Ukrainian soldiers surrender with weapons against the Allies, and they masse up into the arms of the Russian army.
I want to warn you about these fairies.
Because the gun in the hands of the SS only sends the enemy to that world.
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you how much bull it costs in a month and will it work in summer?
Everyone is given strength.

Sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Didn't you get a phone call today regarding the mobile operator fare?
I'm sorry, but I can't expect anyone in this life.
I was offered a job every day today.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there already.
Thank you for responding, and I would like you to find a fine helper
Your father may have told me that there are Jehovah's Witnesses among us, but I don't practice any religion.
However, he is baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions based on love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and began reading Tohru.
I think there are no middlemen between man and God.
Another way to think about it is to not put a refrigerator at the door of the boys' room.
Thank you so much for helping me.
We're looking for a derchepone to clean up a house here in the village.
An offer of 150 crowns, another partnership with them, a grant to the lady.
I'm scared of a chemical guard, can a doctor see me?
I'm just worried about how we're going to communicate with you.
But we can just look at each other
I was traveling by myself to my mother's house, and there my sister and a friend were going for a ride, and Anastasia asked them to come.
Where's your good hairdresser?
On a good day, Victor approved this house but didn't know how to help this gentleman with papers to get a payment from the rustics and said that with a bank of furniture, there's not enough furniture in there yet.
But I'm very grateful for the hospitality in your sister's home.
We have good doctors here, too. Bye-bye.
We've already cooked food at home and we can't find the keys from the attic.

At the end of each description, you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translator to communicate in Ukrainian and vice versa.
I like the four of us on the same bed in a room where we can't even walk, thank you very much.
Well, did you click the links I sent you above?
For each one of them, you have a free home offer, you have a description, you have a relationship with the owner and the photo.

The international community continues to express shock and resentment after the evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against peaceful populations in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as a provocation.
◊ô◊î◊ï◊î Reports of deaths, rapes, and severely wounded Russian troops of Ukrainian peaceful citizens were worth the sentence, ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î declared the prime minister of New Zealand Jasind Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
‚ñ∏ Russia has to answer to the world for what they have done, ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î she has added, stating that its government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
The Japanese prime minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a violation of international law.
The reports were heard that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into fraternized graves or had been left on the streets in a suburb of Kiev, in the Buchi, by Russian troops who had left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photos that supposedly depict the bodies of executed civilians tied to their hands shocked many and led to further sanctions against Russia and criminal persecution of the guilty.
President Emmanuel Macron of France announced to the radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that the Russian troops committed ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î war crimes in Bush.
 ΩT√©, who happened in Buchi, requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures, said Mackron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed to the Russian export of coal and oil.
The prime minister of Spain, Pedro S√°nchez, claimed that Russian troops could go so far as to do ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î.
" We will make sure that those who commit these war crimes do not go unpunished, " said Sanchez in Madrid.
On a national television program late on April 3, Russian SAS said that Maria Zaharova rejected the charges as a requisition.
She stated without evidence that the United States and NATO had been ordered to discredit Russia.
In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after these materials came into existence does not raise any doubt as to who said, oh, oh, who said, oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Previously, Russia's Miloboroughs also claimed that Bushi's image was one more production of the Kyiv regime &amp;amp; that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the U.N. Security Council to assemble on April 4 to discuss what she called a provocation of Ukrainian radicals in Bush.
On April 4, Russia's next committee issued a declaration that declared ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î investigations, under charges of spreading Ukraine's "indiscretion of the Russian forces. "
The president of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, came on April 3, accusing the Russian troops of doing  Ωgenocide in town, and told the leaders of the Kremlin that they were going to come to Buchi to see what their military had done.
I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out, ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î said Green in a video return, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shootings in the back of her head,  Oh, he said.
He claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian troops should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
When we find people with their backs behind their hands and their head, I don't understand, ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î he said the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucci, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On the streets of a small city, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Radio Freedom Service on April 2 saw the bodies of seemingly civilians on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, Awake! saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
Journalists on AP saw at least 21 people in different Bucci places.
The bodies of one group of nine people, all of them civilians, were scattered on land near what local residents say were using Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from close range.
In all, Ukrainian authorities claimed that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thanks, thank you. We bought everything on the list.
They said, "There is no Kiev," just like the invaders brought the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: loots, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is one more item on this list, and there is still much less information on the removal of the local population into enemy territory.
Since about the middle of March, Russian invaders have been evacuating Ukrainians from temporarily occupied communities into their territory and territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has actually given under the Russian military policy.
Ukrainian Truth has found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" happens and whether there are ways to get back to Ukraine.
The characters in this text came on volunteer evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and with no way out.
Happily, they are alive and in touch with their loved ones.
However, in view of the claims of the Ukrainian authorities, many of the citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under harsh force.
So in Melitopolis, the Russians kidnapped the men of the second delivery building, took the children out without their parents, including 12 - year - old Miroslav, the daughter of the late Ukrainian champion from the voyage of Joseph Zazepinski.
The family of Alexander, Marina, and their 10 - year - old daughter, Wally, moved to Hastings a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov Airport, two miles from his village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although they were civilians.
Like true cereals, Denise and Marina had gathered anxious suitcases in advance, but they didn't have time to evacuate on February 24th.
They didn't have their car, and they didn't take anyone else's car anymore.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V followed by the first missiles.
One of them hit a neighbor's house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone has decided to go.
"On the 6th evening of February 24th, people came into the driveway who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They say, "Hey, who?" I mean, yes.
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there was any weapons.
All the men were questioned if they had served in the army.
The women said, "We came to protect you for orders from Ramsay Cadirov."
It was the Chechen Omon, not even the army, young guys 25-35 years old.
They said, "Well, we've been helped by the Ukrainians in the war, Sascha Billy, who's campaigning with the UA-UNSO "Viking," who was fighting on the side of the Czechs in the first Russian-Czech war, and now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, they took the goods out under the Russian wire, and they brought us six fortunes.
There's also online videos where kids thank Caviar for food.
So they're the ones who got the sausages when they ran the store, and they say, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need the video for Ramsay Ahmatostov."
Nobody particularly wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have seven days to give away our phones," they laughed.
They were also constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said it was a good thing that they came, because they didn't want it, the Ukrainians supported it, and generally the good ones say, "Putin is a bastard, Caviro can't do anything, we can't do anything, because there's families out there."
And most of the time, they weren't fighting, they were going to rob shops, they were looting.
Chickens were brought in, one was tied to one leg of a Geoguy's ribbon, and the other one was called "white tape."
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they got beat up in Bushie, so they didn't even take the dead, so they asked us, "Do you have the artillery?"
What's more, we've got a bunch of bunch of bunches, and they didn't know each other, and the first days they asked for passwords to show whether they were their own or not.
We had them before March 13th, and then the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Gomian parasant.
They put 30 to 40 units of technique between the houses, and we fell into it all the time.
But these came and told us that the ICA was gone, but it's Azov, and they said, "Asov" is already 100 in Ukraine.
The Kiv shit has been going on since early March.
One day a Russian came to visit us, either a desantt officer or a representative of the FSB, saying that there was going to be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio there about Bush, Gostelle, and we thought maybe they gave us a green corridor.
From the beginning, we gave our lists to Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go either there or there.
And they said, "So pity your children's mental state!"
How it worked is they put us in the basement and they started shooting from under the house, or "Gradus" or mortars.
And then it came back... neighboring houses just burned down, and some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct impact on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part did not leave, saying that it was for the traitors of their homeland, that "you will be shot, sold"
We were taken through Chernobyl, and on both sides of the road, there were fevers, broken machines, although the Belarusians told us that Russian vehicles were taking them right away.
There's a lot of Caponics, there's a lot of technique and there's soldiers.
At the Belarusian gate, we passed an improvisable control, a lot of people had no documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in Red Cross tents, given tea.
And here we hear shots fired by a rocket, and you can see that it was the lskandar in Kiev.
Although these Belarusian Red Cross were saying, "No, they're planes flying, they're turning to the border."
But we're from aviation, we're educated, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the camp hall by Gomel.
His manager, Vanger Vasil Stenich, came by, says: "Here I am, Hihol, I am from Chernig.
But I understand that Putin and Lukash here won't stop until these thieves kill you.
Poor people suffer!
We got Lukashenko so nice!
He's gonna say it's gonna be like this."
They offered interviews with Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration said to us, "You're traitors already!"
And people from the Red Cross and the U.N. (at least as they were called) were spreading information that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with our daughter's documents.
We had to get it on Monday, and on Thursday, war broke out.
We were not helped by the Ukrainian consul, and we were told in Minsk at the station that no one would be taken on the bus without passports.
I'm here to tell you, we had a lot of help from the Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
They didn't force it to the sanatorium.
Our second group of migration representatives said you could live here the maximum of a week or a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there's no payout here.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled by Mozia (about 30 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border, we saw missiles flying across Ukraine: rockets first take off, shine beautifully, and then go out.
The people who took the bus to Mosega said that the Russians were always shooting from the polygons.
But I can tell you that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us she would break a son if she called him.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, is not believed at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They don't understand that their polygons are used to fire in Ukraine.
There were friends in Poland who took us to Estonia.
We're going through the registration now, deciding what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are now probably as much as the Estonian flags.
Marina lived in the territory of a military town in Gostoll, along with her brother's family  And his wife and two children 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the goods and documents.
At night they went to the basement of a neighbor's house to spend the night.
Marina herself could not return home, and in principle she would not be able to find a house anymore.
No one knew exactly anything about evacuation.
Can't you get downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. And you're always welcome!

April 1th, the city's president, Boochi Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the glad tidings on March 31 of the Ukrainian army released the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the whole Kyiv region.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at that time was obscured by fear and hatred, for at the same time it was known that at the same time, at least 280 civilians were shot by the Russians alone.
They were killed right on the street, some having their hands tied, and others were shot in the back of the head, part of which was killed by minors.
Deaths and tortures were found in the village of Motizin Olhu Suhenko, her husband, Igor, and Alexander's son, who had been kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in their brother's grave, Igorya... in the sewers.
A 20 - mile [20 km] drive from Kiev found the bodies of several naked women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there won't be anyone at home.
I ordered a package from Germany with DHL.

President Vladimir Greenski declared that some weapons granted by Western partners were too late.
He said this in an interview with Associated Press, which he published Ops President, writes "European Truth. "
"All the equipment, all they're sending already, for some kind of equipment it's done too late.
So what if we, for example, are talking about Mariopolis, when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100 percent support from leaders in some countries, that's true.
And some of the European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Green.
In a matter of question, it's enough weapons to make a difference in war, and the president said, "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war wouldn't happen, or it would look different.
"She'd have evolved differently, we'd have close neighbors' shoulders, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be any wars, " he added.
Remember, the prime minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes armory and anti-border weapons.

Marina but really, if you need help from the city, my husband and I will help.
My friend and I were baked yesterday, try it if you want to.
Everyone was sick, and they had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
I just got a call from a lady from Dameidlo who said they would drop me off on email about what was going on and I wouldn't answer.
She spoke Czech and I understood her that way.
But on an e-mail, I don't have a lady's letter.
I'm gonna need little flat-cutters to pull the failure into the plastic.

You'll agree with the lady on your own.
Sure, but I'm confusing you.
Men also have a lot of nuances.
He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my sight of life I was dating him, then I left him.
He was a very rich man, and after a while he phoned and informed him that he had had heart surgery.
He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car in my yard, a crocodile-like one, and a roll of hail.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me into the basement, and there were a lot of people, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
And what about the housing you took off the photos?
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science in Ukraine has already refuted this Flake.

Okay, he'll come over there and pick them up.
I'm Not Greedy for Everything
I understand I can't sit with you. I have to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or any Ukrainian TV.

But maybe you need to know more about Czech.
I hope you enjoy my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but she's studying in Czechia on tourism specialities.
You really don't want to come here for a moment with your children, quietly and with your grandmother.

Mrs. Agatha, if you want this picture, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make us live here as best we can.

"I tell her that I've fixed the TV and the radio, "and I've pulled up the import details, and my friends and friends are warned not to be pushed around when they call.
"For a whole month we've been hiding from the mother-in-law of war.
So far, that's working.
However, the Plum (cat ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î UP) on the navel and hind legs may be the result of stress, changes in food, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, and the stress doesn't depend on me, unfortunately.
Unlike the mother - in - law, the bottle is not deaf, the hearer is hearing both sirens and explosions."
Because Olga can't hear well and spend most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in her apartment for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polov took up arms for the first time in his life.
" For 33 days I lived in an apartment with her as a guerrilla.
Wars were both hidden from her, and the fact that I came next to her formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her friend talked, I gave her the receiver, and she listened four hours later she sang for two hours.
The radio was always near the bed.
Most of my mother - in - law spends most of her time in her room.
I didn't smoke well. It allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I've heard the sound of its thugs, I've been hiding in my room.
First, I hid the receiver and the TV.
And then everyone who's in contact with her called, six or seven people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything, not war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
April 17th -- I got 2 apartment cleaning:)
Good evening, I never thought about it.)

I suggest men's haircuts, women's, children's outings to you, all of you interested in writing in personal e-mails, price:
I understand you and I don't complain, but in my situation, I'll keep looking here.
I'm telling you, the embassy is just here,
A British man who defended Mariopolis in the army said he was ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British military commander in Ukraine's armed forces who is taking part in the defense of Mariupol told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Titter's page Aedina Eislin, British who has served in the ZSU lava since 2018, with a reference to Assin's family and friends, Atlas News, with a reference to the words of a friend Eisin, who talked to him
It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariopolis, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammo left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon end."
Eisslyn served in the 36th individual marines of the ZSU in the defense of Mariupol.
Journalists in the V.C. contacted the mother, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son had announced that they were planning to surrender.
A second military soldier, Brenan Philips, also confirmed to journalists that in his last phone call, Aislin told of the plans of their surrender unit.
He said that the crew had run out of ammo and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eisina's unit was going to surrender to Russian units to avoid being shot without a weapon and bullets at the hands of the so-called "Caviars" forces.
Social media also carried an audio recording of Aislin's telephone conversation with a friend of American friends who was planning to travel to Ukraine.
Ayslyn said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British used to say that in Instagram, he was threatened by representatives of the Wagger private military company.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017, he went to fight against terrorists in what is called the Islamic state of Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the ZSU ranks and took an oath.
Aysina's friends and close friends called Johnny, and in social networks, he's more famous under Cossack Gundi's noodles.

I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the country, so I can and do a lot of physical work.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition. We go like this on Christmas Eve.
Last week the Supreme Council approved a bill of 7,776, which is called "As to monitoring the potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economy."
It is surprising that in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economy has turned out to be... the meeting place of the board members of the State Bank and the State Banks.
Lawmakers believe that making decisions by the management council of the Soviet Union may somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We know of a lot of new dangers to the dergcompani, but we don't know yet about any company that needs physical supervision at the location of the board.
The potential threat of such a law understood this to be a perfect basis for bringing up all gains in difficult reforms after the Hydnas Revolution, including independent boards, and then for hand management.
The same as before 2015.
Why would the civil servants of the oversight council, and who should be included?
Moreover, if, under patriotic slogans, one harmful bill will fly off tomorrow, for example, by ProZoro or NB.
Many things can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative had appeared before the war and the legislation of 7,776.
On February 22th, this standard was added to a comparative bill of 5,397 legislation.
In general, the desire to distribute the board in one way or another has been running among some national electors for a long time.
Not to be critical of such things, but to show the possible consequences of the legislation, we're going to look at arguments that explained the necessity of adoption.
And then we're going to give you our suggestions on how to solve the question of management of business during the war.
The first U.S. secretary of economy, Denise Kudin, explained the need for such innovation by the risk of Internet loss and other means of communication that would make it impossible for a remote administrative council to do so.
In other words, the oversight council is not going to be able to make the necessary decisions in terms of what the company may be doing.
We agree that there is a risk, but will he be able to prevent the transfer of the board members to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a pretty cynical situation where independent members of the board (mostly composed) will put their personal security ahead of the company's interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, the law can set them free.
And then, it's probably going to result in the loss of the quadrotor needed to make any decision.
Instead, it is not possible to quickly appoint new independent board members, since the law requires competition, which, on average, lasts three to four months.
So the proposed legislation 7,776 decisions will probably not be able to prevent the oversight of the Council from making decisions - rather, it will!
National Department, the author of the David Potalooch bill, gives other arguments to support it.
In particular, he notes: "Many businesses, especially the defense-producing complex (FAC), are now in need of relocation," and therefore "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom, discuss addresses and other sensational information."
To begin with, Ukraine has very few OPC responsibilities to oversee.
The CPR is unless it's Ucroboronprome, which essentially runs most of the COPs.
But even at Wrocroboropro, according to law, the board has relatively limited authority, and all its members serve a role that is not free of charge.
All the power in Ucrobourme belongs to the CEO, who, by the way, will decide whether or not the rest of the company that's part of the concept is required.
In addition, this argument does not stand up to criticism, since the lawyer 7,776 makes no changes in the legislation that regulates the job of the U.S.A.
Dr. David on his Facebook page also gives an argument that can be classified as emotional.
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the civil sector and the dergebanks, but let's try to clear up some of them: "paying foreign experts at the first word, in 2021 leaving Ukraine, but they are still members of the control council in Ukraine full of state enterprises with several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war. "
First of all, it's manipulation that most of these board members have never lived in Ukraine, and they've only come here periodically.
So to say that they're going to stay in Ukraine, which is, in a sense, unfair.
Second, as a result of this pandemic, the foreign and Ukrainian boards have long practiced online meetings.
This tool has long been used in world practice, in absolutely different fields: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
Don't forget, too, that membership in the board board is not a full-time job.
Such people usually have other employment, and electronic communication is what helps them to do so.
Third, all these statements are read as claims solely to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dimitro doesn't make identical claims to the board members who are Ukrainians.
Because they're not where they're going to find their companies either.
By the way, it's not the first populistic attempt to get foreigners out of surveillance, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I'm in Ukraine looking for options for a temporary shelter, two kids with me.

We usually need one of the adults' passports.
In the Brewarski, Viszgorod, and the Bushian regions of the Kyiv region that were released from the occupations will usher in an extended curfew for 2 days.
Pavluk's direct language: "In the communities of the Brovarsk, the Viszgo and the Bucha area, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been increased!
In the areas of these cities and villages, restrictions will work from 9:00 p.m. April 2 to 6:00 April 5. "
Details: According to the county's head, it is strongly forbidden to be on the streets of communities and other public areas, to travel by road and on foot.
The residents can only go outside during the alarm signal to take cover.
Such restrictions are introduced to clear up the effects of Russian aggression.
The Omega called for people who had left these areas to hold back from returning home.
In the rest of Kyiv, curfew will last from 9: 00 a.m. to 6: 00 a.m. every day.

The Luschenko regime forces arrested three Belaruss of 27 and 28 years of age involved in the destruction of the two rail cabinets under Opplesovics, which provides the movement of train trains.

At the Belarus I.M., it was reported that at 30 p.m., with the assistance of the USS Special Forces, three of them were arrested, one of them injured.
The men were actively opposed and tried to escape, says the report.
Safety forces have used weapons.
One of the prisoners is injured and is in a medical facility.

The chief criminal police officer of the ISS of Belarus's Handicrafty Police stated that "excess terrorism on the RB railways will be severely abandoned by the military using arms.

Where he is now and in which he is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railways were arrested in Belarus.
Remember, BYpol's formation, declared by Lukashenko's extremite regime, continues to summon Belaruss into diversies and Belarus's infrastructure as part of the Permoga plan.
Belarusian "raw guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
Because of Belarus, it is known that RF is overthrowing the country to fight, and in Ukraine there is living power and technology.

The U.S. bans investment and sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is setting up new sanctions against President RF Putin's daughters, the largest RF Alpha Bank and Sbyrbank banks, and bans all new investments in Russia.
That's what the White House report says.
Sbyrbank is Russia's largest financial institution within government ownership, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
It's going to freeze any of their assets with regard to the U.S. financial system, and it's going to ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in RF.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Bayden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of where they are located.
"This step is based on the approval of more than 600 transnational companies to decide how to get out of Russia.
The outputs of the private sector include producers, energy companies, large retail merchants, financial institutions, and other providers like legal and consulting firms, and they're referring to the White House statement.
The third step in new U.S. sanctions was to limit large Russian state enterprises to critical areas.
It forbids U.S. citizens to operate on these organizations and freeze any of their assets into U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of Minfins will be published next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is full of assets from the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the foreign minister of Lavov, and members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-president and prime minister of Russia Dmitri Medvedev and prime minister Michael Misustyn.
Banks turn them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the pass is closed, and I'll come to you.
Wary, can we wash the dishes in the car yet?
My name is Olga, and before the war, I worked as a flight attendant for Skyaap, my mother who was an industrial seamstress, and my little Macarczyk used to go to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, but we didn't even think we would have to run because we didn't have the strength to hide in the cellar.
I was fortunate enough to find a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that for the first time, someone will take us in. We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if that's what we can afford.
Cleanness and order are guaranteed.
We don't have any bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help during such a difficult time.
I had an English lecture in the afternoon and then went to work in the nursery.
There I explained to Margaritha how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she's got it all figured out and will do well.
I also met a lady named Lena who spoke to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's a free swim.
You can call the school, Kira doesn't take the phone, doesn't say "I don't know"
They isolate the Russian office by stopping investment and stopping supply.
But we didn't get along.
Our house did not have military personnel.
Our home is near the military section and the naphtobaza
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
Cooked well, I don't ask too much, and I give good advice.
I'm taking care of myself.
It's a little hard for me, but I know I have to go through this phase.
We'll see you on Thursday and I'll tell you everything.
Everything's fine.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I clean up every week.
I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Wanted to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move yet, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard the information, you'd let me know.
I would love to rent a house with a decent girl.
If you know one, let him know.
I won't let you down on my own.
Thank you early.
I haven't written to you another man, Natasha, 54 years old. Please write to me the exact address and the price of the course.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it's one from birth:)
I'm sorry I didn't see you, and I'm going to send you right away.
We're going to medical service now.
I mean, you don't have to do this hour another day.
What day is it best for her to arrive early?
I'll listen tomorrow, bad Internet, good night.
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.
Thanks... a little something came out of things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both beginners, besides the alphabet, don't know anything.
Nothing's happening.
May I see you on Monday, 25.04?
Children can be taken with you, toys are enough here:)
I Heard About Dad
I may be very naive or very in love, but I'll come up with some of this money.
We'll do it sometime.
But how will this be paid, please, no loans.
Write me straight and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should we take with us what they gave us?
Today is not my day. They broke the blinds in the living room.
Something from you is here. I don't see it.
I'm also very sad.
I'll remind you of faction later.
Is it only your father who speaks and understands Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do cleaning and how many windows does a house have?
I'm ashamed I'm distracting you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but tell you, there's a message from Mariopol for my son, alive and in formation.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenz, and he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new connections neurons.
Natalie Nagoorn, a TV journalist, published a video on the morning of April 12, which was given to her by the 36th Marine Corps crew of Maripolis.
In it the military said that they had no weapon left to engage in battle, and the mountain was wounded.
They said it was "counting goes for an hour."
Before that, on April 11, 36th, the Marine Corps team, which is part of the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement stated that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian army was not tied to the fighters for two weeks.
The social survey stated that the application had been published in Russian.
Valerentian of Ukraine's Armed Forces, Valerilla, assured us that the bond of defense with the defense forces in Mariopolis was not to be a subject of public debate, and the details of the defense should not be a subject of public debate.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azstall plant area and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian invaders laid the toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariopolis.
As reported by RF's leader, the Azostal Army has used chemical weapons over the AzSTal plant, which is holding the Azov troops.
Thank you, I will conform to you, that would be very nice.
The situation is the same, so far we're staying here.
Time to drive two hours) to walk, mother to shops and back)
It's no big deal.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czech escardria has since started flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional copters will be used for detection, and some of them will be used for the direct destruction of an enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian brothers and two Czech brothers were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday because of the deputation of the Muscachi City Hall of Vladimir Labubenca.
Today, their intergierary friends led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/exampleher101/Bulil Schurmer delivered drones by assignment: they received special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to make maximum use of the hooves effectively and safely, their dyscalation will now remain secret.
Four friends who help the Czech army stop on what they're doing say they're going to send a lot of interesting keels to Ukraine that will serve as the destruction of the Russian occupation and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, I'm fine, I love sweet, but I can do without him.
I'm worried we won't make it, a lot of luggage.
Back to Ukraine soon, keep working
All right, if it's all right, I'll take it.
I'll try it myself, but if I get in the wrong direction, I'll write it to you if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in a lady elder's village in Jawawa, she saw me, and that I was pregnant but said there's no living room.
Maybe she'll be happy and cheer up.
I had my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet each other when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop the music you like.
I'm curious about how much music you've got
Mom and Dad Need to Listen
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It was cooler and rain today. It must be warm by tomorrow.
But no pity for destroyed houses, no pity for people who have been abused by the invaders.
In Kherson, the invaders got rid of the United States Memorial in Kherson Street in Perkopi.
Details: Unknown ones are said to have ripped down the flag of the European Union, to triple panels with photos of skynet hundreds and killed in the Russian Ukrainian war.
The Occupunctures have ripped away the sights of the hundreds and dead in the Russian Ukrainian War.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the kids for the stroller, we don't have this custom, so we didn't know, we only gave the kids chocolates and cookies, maybe there was something else we needed to give.
Chessy has someone to talk to, if any.
'Cause I'm living in a dormitory until twelve, there's people here, and then I'm going to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I've already seen it today.
Even today, it's already slept there.
So we've made great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the cooked ones back another time!
# Today I have no strength to make them #
Since I'm pushing away from the days and times in which there's cleaning after the guests, I might say about April, because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartment.
By May I can say roughly at the end of April or the beginning of May.
Just asked if you were talking about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't write dinner off for a long time and sleep a little.
If you wouldn't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll meet after you arrive.)
He's modest, he's been studying a lot lately, and he realized he needed it very much in his life.
Hi, it went really well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people in such a high position.
Today there has been a lesson in a lady who is the director of the state's economy at an altitude.
She was very pleased with my work.
The dirt in the light behaves well.
On Monday, I'll have confirmation of my employment as well as cash payment for the ashes.
I'm lazy from Friday.
I don't do a lot of things to them, and I sleep a lot (and a lot of water)
If there's a doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if you can.
I'm gonna have to get another analysis.
Don't have to go again.
We need a master, we need to fix it.
That's how it's done.
Can you send me the right e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech course you signed for.
And are the children being fed there or should they be brought with them?
Now, for a moment, there's one question I can ask you.
If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover tonight, right?
We didn't want you to raise money from the beginning, so people don't think we're speculating about it!
But I didn't have two options to fill up online:
I'm going to rest, to get strength and energy, thanks for today's gift, good night.
This is going to be a good thing because the whole family is going to paint.
The University of California urges workers and students to check carefully any information, not to trust anonymous sources in Messers and social networks, gossip and gossip.
Use only official information.
Yes, you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
I gathered some work for the portfolio.
After holidays, the Internet should be spent.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How am I going to count my day off from work is an obstacle?
headquarters: Russia prepares a provocation in Prinstrovya to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may use provocations in the Poddnov region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "acgression against neighboring state."
It says, "It is not illegal to engage in military action in the Russian Federation of Processation Action in the region of Moldova, in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to establish an offensive group for action in the Slobosian direction.
Likely, in the near days, the invaders will try to regain the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and ship a special armor, arms, and military equipment in Ukraine.
The preparation of arms and military equipment is under way in the context of a permanent dislocation of 60 separate mobile - gun crew (Monastres) of the 5th general army of the East Military District.
Likely, the pointed arms will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donez region.
Also, to restore the loss of a special member of the Battalion Tactical Group made up of 36 separate mobile - gun crew (Bora, Zabacca) 29 of the general army of the East Military District are commissioned by the assembly of military personnel of the noted team.
The challenge is particularly great when you put in the position of drivers and driver mechanics.
The absence of a special warehouse from the permanent dyscalation is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that in order to disrupt the supply of supplies to the battlefields, strikes will continue to take place on subjects of transportation infrastructure in Ukraine to destroy or destroy them.
The armed forces of the Belarus Republic continue to carry out a mission to strengthen the Ukrainian border in the Brest and Gomel area.
In the Slobosian direction, individual units of the 6th Common Army and the northern fleet's coastal forces continue to block the city of Harkovo, and there are artillery shootings going on in parts of the city.
In the Izumian direction, air - raiding areas are under way to find the positions of Ukraine's Armed Forces.
The opponent uses Orlan-10 for this.
In the strengths of the two Battalion Tactics, the enemy tried to make his attack in the direction of the communities of Longke and Dmitri, without success and away from the earlier occupied positions.
In the Done side, the main efforts of the enemy continue to focus on the communities under the control of the Postan, the Rubiszne, the Lower and the Novobachmutian, and the full control of the city of Maripolis.
The enemy tried to storm the Golden District, but he did not succeed.
In the city of Mariustal, artillery and aviation, the invaders continue their assaults on the region of Asstal and the seaport.
The forces of individual units were armed with artillery firing positions of Ukrainian troops in the communities of the High Optela, Trudauchuc, and Mar likeian.
In the region of Donez and Lugana, four enemy attacks have been recovered in last day's region, five plus tanks, eight units of armored, six units of automobile technology, and eight artillery systems of the opponent.
Don't you get it?
We'll usually try to make it, but I doubt it.
And you want to sleep, and I'm holding you down.
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me tonight, so tell me, I get it.
We didn't watch TV at home, and we don't have to set up 1 + 1.
I'm just going to turn on the TV just to listen to Czech.
I'm running out of fares per month today:)
Can we do that on the phone today?
Buy cloth for sewing, canvas, thread for sewing
I understand that I can prepare the material in this area.
I'm going to ask her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask her, and she gives us so much pie.
I'm going to meet my father later, and I'm going to do that.
I read a Facebook report, so I guess Google wrote something in his own way.
Good afternoon, we brought the things you brought, but are there things that we can get in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If Mr. Director is available, I can start work next week because I plan to go to work by lunch tomorrow at the Office of Labor (if I get there because it's too big a queue) and it's raining on Saturday:)
I was looking for a crew at the beginning, and I loved chemistry at school, and I'm learning Czech to know perfectly, and I want to work on Tavi.
Friends are old and not very good, friends that I don't know personally, friends of mind and spirit.
Now you too have had a hard time.
During the past month, I have been associating with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy without it, has turned upside down, and that of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed because of the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because they're putting Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been in danger for a long time, and you're getting ready for the final blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote Alexander Cherkasova, my very old friend from "Memial."
I'll tell you a little bit later, and as usual, Sash replied......
Others, as artists, critics, or writers, have been impressed by the sudden fall of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and Fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: Except for very few of you, you know, those of you who worked at the Memorial, in the "New Newspaper," on "Eho Moscow," in "Meduzi," the Naval Organization, and in a bunch of other places, did many of you do anything to resist this regime?
Apart from participating in meetings while they were taking place.
Also read the column of Russian journalist "It's Late to Hide, It's Late to Silence."
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstraction?
Are they caused by your long - standing indifference to what's going on around you, your apathy and your passive singing, which is now perhaps a huge burden on your soul and heart?
That wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period where you, to some degree, possessed freedom and democracy, was promiscuous, even bloody, but genuine.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up having such a strong fear of the serpent that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let's say his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think he's safer around him.
Yes, errors were made.
Instead of taking and publishing the KGB archives, like the Germans in the Stasi did, you took your soul to the Dzinski Memorial and let the KGB lie down, update itself, re-form and take control of the country.
When you were faced with a choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option.
In 1998 your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of the mass protests for large social justice or against the Chechnya war.
Survival became the main concern.
Then Putin came along, young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to settle down with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but either you voted for it or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya to the ground, most of you closed your eyes.
I remember well those years.
I was at the time working in Chechnya, helping victims out of the Trans-Terrorism operation, and seeing with my eyes the ruins of the Grozno, Qatar Yurt, Itum-Kala, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends, I would go back to Moscow and hang out happily with you friends of mine.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the tortures of the peaceful citizens, the deaths of children, the soldiers who sold their bodies to their families.
You said, "Bred, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And I said, "Friend, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your power to bomb one of your cities, to kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of the zeros, due to rising oil prices and the willingness of Putin to condone the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in middle class pockets.
Many of you are making good money, some are getting rich, and even the poorest of you have obtained new housing and better employment.
Prices grew, but isn't that a problem?
Moscow was shining and bald by the seams.
When several of you were killed by opposition, you were shocked by the horror of what was happening.
However, the matter did not go away.
When, after two terms, Putin passed the post on to President Medvedev, and he was the prime minister himself, you can see that you barely paid attention to it.
When, after a few months of Medvedian Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or refused to do so.
How many of you have met in the following years on the slopes of Guauri, in the foothills of Kazbehi or at the cafe and in Turkish baths in Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, it's unlikely that we in the West did a lot of things if we did anything at all.
A little resentment, some sanctifications; but what was the significance of Russia's blatant violation of international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the inner market was so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, that was the most important thing.
At the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up after all.
When Putin again changed seats with Medvediv and took up the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you joined in protests.
Nabal's name became known, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt terrified that it was losing the soil beneath your feet.
After that, he struck back.
Alternative action was first organized, then repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Some people have got huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I'm still hearing it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Inflamed by the Russian president who fooled their European expectations, they captured Maidan once and never abandoned him.
On their own, they built a tent town and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they used sticks, armatures, and Molotov cocktails to defend themselves.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters were attacked.
Many have died, but they have won.
The refugee has become Janukowitz, and the Ukrainians have given themselves democracy, the right to choose their own leaders, and get rid of them if they don't do their own thing.
Putin did not like the Mayan.
That was a bad example.
So he used a common turmoil to capture the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but the benefits were few.
And how many of you were excited!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the insension.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who had despised Putin and his shaik suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to idolize it.
I find it hard to find the reason, since right after that, we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks, away from the restoration that the mayor of Moscow started in 2012, with their bandages, the public Wifty and Hipster's cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, weren't there?
The ID or anything, even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria, opened it up at that time in an interview because I didn't really understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw government snipers shooting my kids in cold blood at their peers on the streets of Homs.
Of all Russian citizens, it was only your soldiers who, in 2015, started to bomb thousands of civilians, acquiring experience for the next serious war.
No doubt many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"First they came for socialists, but I remained silent because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I remained silent because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you were talking about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some are really talking about how, for example, Dimitro Gloucowski, Mikhail Schishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Max Ollsov, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î from the middle of the country, like Marina Ohannikov, risking getting into a new GULAG or building a company called Nail.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin gets to the Ukrainians, or seems very likely, if he doesn't, he'll take care of you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who were brave, but for the most part, went off alone to protest, and it's still a minor term, but soon you'll get more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petition, who has expressed a disagreement in social networks (or even a black square in Instagram) or who has spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were just a joke, they're not in such a distant past, and now they're very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who's going to speak for you, who's going to stay?
The example of Ukrainians is even more than 2014, and that's what's scary about the Polish regime: they're proving that you can fight it.
And that mind, motivation and courage can stop him, however oppressive his advantage may be.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize that this is true, as is the case with war at all.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on right now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you associate.
And Putin knows what you know.
So stay alert.
You see where it's going.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your choices, they're just hokhma, your laws, if you don't consider repressive, are worth no more than the paper they wrote on, your latest free media, your economy is going to collapse faster than I'm writing, you don't have any credit cards to buy a plane abroad, even if there are any flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you might try going out or you might get hurt.
I doubt you'll see another option.
And yet there's another one left.
Who will eventually break this regime.
And maybe under the circumstances, you're going to need less than you think.
Think about it.
It's not going to explode because of the economic collapse that's coming on Russia, it's probably going to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices go up and wages aren't paid, people who voted for Putin all those years because they wanted bread and peace will come out.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, which is you my friends.
But if each city goes to meetings on its own, as has been the case over time, it will not find it difficult to suppress them alone.
The crowd will have to be turned into mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool, the Internet, that can limit, but that can still work, and that can be fixed in almost any circumstance.
The Navala organization has been defeated, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, there are millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If you get over 300,000, it's going to be flabbergasted.
We'll have to use an army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, what did he make them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel the fear you understand, and those who have children will be afraid for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid, too, if I were you.
In the case of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their masters who dare not just demand freedom but who are really trying to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son is going to be a joke in a computer game chat and he's going to be arrested; your daughter is going to express indignation on the Internet and be arrested; your dear friend is going to make a mistake  And die in a raw cell under the police oaks.
This is what has been happening for many years and will only intensify as it gets bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice, and if you don't do anything, you know where it ends.
Do it coolly, think strategically, and get it to become a reality.
We were on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home by the end of the day.
What do you see me as a secretary's press?
Vico, how often do you go to your expensive restaurant for dinner?
Once in the course I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant
I'll try to explain it to her.)
That's how we liked very good and we wanted something nice, so it's a better version.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people, and I was tired energyly.
I feel sick, cough, temperature, voice, weakness, and head rolling
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done it, but they said who registered in April was half the money just at the end of the month.
We need a pass Thursday. We'll go to the doctor with the children.
But at night, I had a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm looking forward to her news, and I'm sure I'll let her know.
While working in the prosecutor's office, I thought that I was building a career, and I spent so much time and energy.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, mental job that completely disappointed me.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my private life, I am communicable, but my love for marriage and my love for marriage are serious.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think that in order to make seven people, I think they have to love, respect, trust each other.
I've never met one of them before.
Good morning: Where in Eygalwa can you buy molds for pasta or silicone?
All right, thanks for the advice, and I'm going to file a Valya certificate.
She has a D.C. in a lying state, her leg is broken in a plaster, her wheelchair is lying down, the food is all crushed in a blender.
