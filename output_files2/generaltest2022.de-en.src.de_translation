The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# big customer and so it's no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction which I should add to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's have a look, give a little help, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is alone for a short time and it's okay with him, that's good.
You can judge for yourself if that fits your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Of course, whether this is a risk you want to take is your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember having read a thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story, but I don't want to think of the title partout again maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by lapping himself with food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously assigned to go and document the location of the suicide and put the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately confronts the patients in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out the window another rides with intent to death)
This face of fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough story I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If someone knows this story, or if even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, my God, I don't have the password available for the WiFi.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 y., splitter under the thumb nail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood chip under the thumb nail (outside).
Trying to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child is hysterical when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we'll see the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotives of track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" loudspeaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
He can handle the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital center.
It is capable of all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with matching centers.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
Always new Omikron cases provide politics and science in the UK.
By the New Year, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress in the Corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers than he has been aiming for so far.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said to his compatriots on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one faced an emergency, which is why the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news was that the level of protection could be increased with a third dose.
"Let's get a boost!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, increasing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at collection?
I'm in favour of everyone imagining pronouns
I sent you an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him, and depending on where he/she got a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to kick an official over my feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves to pronouns.
I've got five books on it.
Four of them.
Only the one I bought today is not possible
Obviously, the chair had an apparent lack of sales.
How can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
==References====External links==
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books from the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write a little bit detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons, I (21) have more frequent contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately is far too common is that many victims cannot be helped or think we could not help them.
I realize that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is partly very close to tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, remember, you're worth living without violence, it's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the good of the show for "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was dependable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said at the beginning of October with a review of the trophy defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the match, however, she did not lay down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Bundesliga.
More than the naked result, however, disappointed the way of the performance.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma is mentioned as representative: the three-way ratio was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young John Patrick) at 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we trained".
Which is moving the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a cool game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena, but they were at their expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
In Patrick's team, even the performers Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all along the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and reached up to eight points after they had already been back 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to fight.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We were legally informed again, so we wrote them again.
We first registered half a year ago.
Always as out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of Schlager from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't happen.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the Corona virus.
Also other of his planned appearances during Advent must fail, as it is called on the website of the singer, who becomes 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January on, the artists want to catch up on their dates already published in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986, together with fellow students, he founded the Palast Orchester.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the comedian harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair tightly combed back and focused on etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colourful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies, for example, is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightenings in the rental right.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 deaths from tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have traversed the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes in the United States have caused serious devastation and may have killed up to a hundred people.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer long wind of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere the tornado had gone, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
In the state of Kentucky alone, he expects up to a hundred deaths, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out display case #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely out of the assortment?
Is there the possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you be in touch?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or given up a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this arrived or was being processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
They are thus in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to use Corona vaccinations.
He moved to a company he was blaspheming about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself in his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time, anyway.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the Greetings!
For a group of 4 friends, I'm heading the adventure About the Greifenpass and want to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual file is invented and now I am about to write the entry adventure and stumble on my own feet already at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a cart with Gratenfels grain to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of Goblins is supposed to lie in wait for the hero and lure him into an ambush.
I want to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
In the absence of notice, the Goblins lurk the hero in a hollow path and flank the cart with three bows to the left and right, while two with spears stop the cart.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-eleven.
The cart's gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-eleven intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the help of the heroes in battle.
The cart's still there. Everything's great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start the adventure?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly heed many of your ideas and now also have more confidence in my narratives.
I broke up the lamp again.
And put back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can then let the return receipts come, then I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

Here was the lower part, so quasi the part with storage space damaged.
Will everything then be picked up or only the storage space part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more throughout the season, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was canceled in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 has priority and therefore has to restrict itself to everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so neither knew that one can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, they only came to the conclusion that verstappen may change the tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this topic.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there is this possibility for staggering.
I believe that such elementary rules should be known simply by commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first riddle guessing, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally speaking, Roos doesn't like the artificial commentary style, but admits that it's a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant absurdities, both of which simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a great deal of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over Sky, in the run-out Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to with F1TV since only the German sound track has to get along without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as free TV stations.
Although Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very meager and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-language channel that broadcasts the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races, except for advertising.
In any case, the fantastic F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it was going to be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she was going to check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for backup.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect several ejectors.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an Auströmer or similar...and it can start.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water would run backwards that runs the water from the pool through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, so is packed daily and the packages are also collected daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent anyone from being upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like that, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry...of course, no Corona is stopping here.
Please do not rate equally badly, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to scold about these services, even if we say at the moment... they've got it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrest?
Can you order your legs here in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four more passengers have made a short trip to space.
On Saturday they were transported by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the Blue Origin company by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies Bezos personally received the newly chosen astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the missile system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not tell.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies to a height of 100 kilometres
The rocket system "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, sometimes with weightlessness, before the reusable object was re-arranged by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometres above the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-trip from Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second one in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy boss of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I had already informed myself about career prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I would like to study and become a PhD student.
At the moment, however, I am in doubt, especially oppressive of my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) one hears again and again super career opportunities and the profession is totally wanted, on the other hand one hears again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd be interested in:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study / what did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
At the moment, I am really unsure and may consider canceling my studies in 2022 and training as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have experience there she also likes to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now a post for that.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also pre-public holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails, which had to be out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *obligatory* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week" sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also deeply annoyed.
What's this self-sacrifice about holidays?
Then why do we still have holidays if we can't treat ourselves properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all on their own.
My question is simple: are we the Swiss?
Is that our reformed evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The nice thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree on the feast by baking cookies with her son and making cookies.
"I love this," said Catterfeld.
But until the contemplative days she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mouse and the plumage regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the plumage damage occurring in bird farming is due solely to nutritional defects.
Since the plumage is made of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses occurring during the Mauser are due to lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you so much, I found it
Unfortunately still doesn't work
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, die Lok war in Schlesien und Mitteldeutschland im Einsatz, die sehr raren Lok erhält probably from the conversion proposal of the model railway company ME Heft 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electrolocomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal whole trains in the Silesian network, possibly the construction kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working on it
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains at 45 km/h of cruising speed on this route.
The top speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG designated the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part, as a 1-Co+Co1-Moco locomotive with a Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received service numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnvermögungswerk Dessau, the reworkability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As a result of the increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight trains, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were processed in 1959, with the remaining machines being used as spare parts dispensers.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 available in larger quantities were first developed preferably.
Only when the E 94 could be expected that the reprocessing number could not be increased further, did the E 95 come into focus of the reprocessing.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were used in their own orbital plan mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of locomotives proved problematic.
Thus, it often happened that shooters remained stuck at switching shops.
Then the Beimann with hammer and wooden wedge had to release the shooter while driving on this locomotive.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most splinter types, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only once, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which acknowledges the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a turnout heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external reworking of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The locomotive was completed in 1986.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995 employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five driving motors were operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main operational area was initially Silesia.
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive in own work is necessary, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell!!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - perhaps the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and bearing marks.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get sent new ones.
When will they be sent out?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the shape, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
Main thing they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat with me
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has occurred, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjoining house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to the report, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume intentional firing.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
She'll be there a lot later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To invalidate fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech chief Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly expressed his opinion on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness had moved him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the corona virus.
On social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has refused, because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been on a respirator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask about the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle circulates, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed to receive the vaccine myself by law," said Şahin at the time.
There was a prioritisation in Germany in the vaccination of Vakzin.
In the meantime, prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to get along without electricity for about 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights ran out on Friday evening with 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The provider Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the people concerned for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless commitment," said Florian Witt, Head of the Primary Technology Division, in a message on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would take a few more days, as the Westnetz-Monteurs were only able to put some lines into operation temporarily at first, he explained.
According to company information, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire broke out on Friday around 7.15 p.m. in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switchgear.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m. onwards.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last ones affected by the failure would also have electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday noon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and report to the local fire brigades if assistance is needed," explained District Councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was on the residents of old people's homes when setting up and operating emergency power units.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or who needed medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy these from you and pay in euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the underframe on the table top.
It's Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 of them.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it into one another and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I'd have to send her back, otherwise it's not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like that!
Will you send me the return receipt by e-mail?
The repair has now been completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are sprinted on the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to face the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big advance after ski jumping into the cross-country ski run.
Return order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both remaked s and use version 4.5...
could be that they've heard of problems before
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be error reporting to customer service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection's gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application becomes even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly line next to line.
A slight overlap of the colour layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick to and fro wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could come through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal shimmers can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you build them.
The models achieve true-to-original appearance through the decals or decals.
From royalties on aircraft to ship names to trims and license plates for car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Insert the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or slightly glued before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a quiet hand when glued.
Cut out each decal you need individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slide pictures, because you moisten their back with water briefly until the backing paper becomes dark through the wetness.
Then you push the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is right before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, crease or even tear.
Suck excess water with a household towel.
Caution not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log off and log in and reload the book and look for the place until I have read it.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Ok, thank you anyway!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Can I get that back without a problem?
Child care at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello, everybody.
we have been in child care for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, this suddenly turns across.
In turn:
We had applied to the PKV for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance and received the confirmation of 3 tests.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first experiment led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was charged with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and did 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet expect the PKV.
We once again applied for the cost to the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we did more experiments than promised, logically counting the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second child's wish was a new case of insurance.
According to the general terms and conditions, however, "the insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out in the promises that with one birth the further attempts would have lapsed?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how best to reach them again?
All right.
We won't order anything from them anymore.
When they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague said to me that the repayment was arranged and now you tell me that I have to send that thing back first.
I can't help it that the chest of drawers arrive with me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the repayment was initiated and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I'm not able to get another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools, but we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low budget film** or **low budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find lots of lists of low-budget movies, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
Why are you so excited about this?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
Yours sincerely,
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable manner, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This suspended state - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels to be a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It does not seem to be able to prevail if a Member State is in the head to do its thing", as Poland is currently doing, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU paid another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a fundamental agreement on asylum policy was made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" had been strengthened.
Re-experiment of crossing the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to reach Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, said a spokesperson for the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been stoned by the migrants in the incident near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the leader of Minsk, of attracting them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has put its market power into balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk should also take account of domestic costs.
The Belarusian society was probably not prepared to allow the security apparatus regularly to shut thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen has committed two breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Following the controversial Abu Dhabi Formula One final, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The Silver Arrows suspect two breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced for his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken the cars before him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and contact you again.
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa Park hosts SC-Freiburg Fan Day
The Europa Park, the name given to the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and permanent ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The rollercoaster trains lit up red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, cooperation has existed between the Bundesliga and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it showed again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun in the roller coaster together confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is the €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€?

I had a lot of trouble with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
yesterday I gave up the contact form for the return of an article, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question was received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and falsely delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Yours sincerely,
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved with up to 16 bit / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your system.
There's practically no difference to the original any more audible.
A Class-D audio terminal with up to 3W output power controls the speakers, which can have between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm impedance.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
All single noises can be individually adjusted in volume.
The superflexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows the model-accurate simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite means nothing.
It's like an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither will admit it to her.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, then you're just as serious as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god got the whole thing going.
But as soon as you're Creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And so you're an enemy of science, and you're not going to be serious like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The especially aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without marking and color errors up to the edge zone.
Often magnifiers are marked with magnification data.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - i.e. also in the case of impact lups - light reflections are created.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - are adhered to, reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situation when selling fir trees.
One time, a man was said to have gone home without his partner, because both of them could not agree.
Every year, he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That's what makes the pre-Christmas time a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher??
Otherwise I am gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And so both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreamer", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable wifi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connector and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit, except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer the full 500, but the further I remove in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket, which is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line with optical fiber?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to have an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Who would have thought that it would be quiet with the current accounts for now, is mistaken.
While many banks used the fall to be confirmed by their customers with all kinds of tricks to confirm the price increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates are also further reduced.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25.000 euros for day-to-day money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as to ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Verivox internet portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros. However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance even got the right against this regulation before the Landgericht Berlin.
It is already being discussed in the banks whether the institutions should possibly form provisions - in case the upper authorities also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and have to be repaid to many millions of bank customers.
The table top was delivered for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood now.
But her life is like a mountain and descent.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who caused a stir in 2021 with the "Friends" reuniting and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treat herself to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans fly to her in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just lucky, and she's still looking for love.
And deleted the baby request from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let us hope that success and fame will also make us happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 went even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped his sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the gang, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsports royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in the Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I calculated this once, I would have to make nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, on Saturday, he defended Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he drove from third to one.
Then he changed a bit of the material adjustment and drove out with 0.30 seconds a bigger advantage on Sunday.
Together with his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier was third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also took his 22nd victory in series production.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came fifth this time after second place.
Christoph Hafer of the BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after fourth place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third win in the Zweierbob on her home track.
After finishing fourth in the Monobob the day before, she raced for the World Cup victory in the German triple victory with pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium in this winter.
The Wiesbaden-based Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama will take me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not just pushing, but there's also a lot to do about it."
Jamanka was annoyed a little about the not quite error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked for it.
Corona gave me quite different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it expired, which upsets me very much.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No, not until I type an extra field with the message
It was picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write, and maybe it's the one - or the other...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we had a lot of cuddling and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
It is also cooled down and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very much to do with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just had a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket and relaxed a bit after I was there with the warm lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework on us, which we of course divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTBS illness is very well set, I'm half well treated and managed.
Not good, but I can handle it and I'm almost symptom free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes then is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just till the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'm gonna pack this ned.
Somehow, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Are you guys feeling the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this has a lot to do with some mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find some kind of pain-comforting women here...
I definitely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Twice, by the way.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them, such as math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed that way.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about colleagues in work and study with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would just be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
Then what makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Do you have a culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write English that I understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd miss it.
All right, thank you.
I expect a response in a timely manner by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (am 24).
I think it's been a film for teenagers.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernism (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it in more detail in the real world anyway, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live for himself.
The transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that tells you anything, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl only slept on her stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can do much more than you think.
Make sure everything around is right, no cuddly animals, go in and watch more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
It's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ohso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it's asleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up from the stomach?
Or is it with the face ahead Right in the mattress?
That's what you can tell if everything's all right.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was like a gang and it would be like putting the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But then why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at this time.
Let's be very clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
But it's just that the politics of this station are now under all hands.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big beggar tour at the same time.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet station.
Quotation Arno: One wants to be "no running Litfaßsäule".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to get his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A krogman who lacks empathy completely and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How are you supposed to like all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask for a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddles – My little warm friend can be used in many different ways.
Cherry cores are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and release dosed again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry-core cushion with cover is only suitable for the following applications as heat coating:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical smell, stick or fire spots and if present, dispose immediately.
Please take the inner cushion to warm up beforehand from the reference!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's information!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion in the cover.
During the first warmings, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the given heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before warming the pillow in the microwave, check that it is allowed to heat grain products in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow in cases of acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh haematoma, bruising and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced feelings of pain.
In existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumours and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.

The cover is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after second series - Pauli wins Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 works from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it does not run under the third coach.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough to operate.
Missing, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged in power supply.
As a result, I removed the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains mode?
Is there something else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the #PRS_ORG# delivered to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment with it?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed with the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what you need for everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the Everyday Line update to version 2 (V2) the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in it - with the Everyday Backpack series Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven its worth in the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal clasp hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most rucksacks, Peak Design has taken into consideration various -filling levels: there are 4 anchor bars, stable riveted, into which the lock hook can be hooked.
When the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to dig through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more about it below) and thus easily store both separately - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of the body from the right side, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# yesterday sent me an email from confirmation for the assignment of the
Contact announced by the forwarding company for the collection of the wrongly delivered table.
I haven't received a message yet.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I'm already writing with the third support employee, with none I got further than the promise that I'll get an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you so much for the help
Wish you another nice evening
hello, my ordernr is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was supplied with a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend my voucher, I'll place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I could not guess and could not redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the requirements of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety in braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are inherent to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the properties of the original assembly by balancing the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, whereby the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake blocks.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs underline the character of every car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were pitched, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll look for gold, recruit workers, collect horses and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to beat your pioneer colleagues so you don't go busting with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to use your resources to budget and build a tableau that works more and more for you.
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can use fine adjustments to develop your individual style of play.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then players alternately perform actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gun heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the prize winner turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on until the pricer has moved five times, so every location has hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gun heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!
For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, goods shipment (games are scanned).
With everything else mostly DPD insured and with tracking (games infiltrated, wrapped with tile and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also ship cardboard in a carton at an additional cost of 2 euros, which is 100% free of printing points.
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD media library
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation showed up in my Twitter timeline today, and I was looking at it right away.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008) he triggered a violent educational debate.
Former patients:inside and educators now make serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other responsible people must never, never, never! go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible and meaningful in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the elimination of testing requirements for triple vaccinated patients
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinations.
"We countries need clarity as to whether and when the test obligation can be waived for three times vaccinated," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated patients is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers on this topic on Tuesday." − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I best do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase via my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, meaning perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, to see images less often, and, most rarely, to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: cesarean sections are operations associated with an increased rate of awareness, since one avoids a very deep anaesthesia to protect the child until it is taken off.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia interview.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, however** u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.
I misread her comment.
The chair is broken, though.
Unfortunately, the 20€ doesn't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I've already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
I'm not gonna be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He has distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental theatre story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, fresh in print: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell to the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I'm here to testify to my life's gratitude".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardised wood pallets, which are used as load carriers, especially in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was about 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year is not collected
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in penalty shooting with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had won over Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash a week ago.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook Rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow, I'll start a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can handle it.
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received by me.
Would you check that out, please?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck belongs to Christmas days such as the fir tree and gifts.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Time's running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything at the "gain" and the distortion.
Further up, it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even speed up a power reserve, if it is sometimes outrageously loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controls, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphones or when recording directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot button, you can also comfortably call up the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and tap the tempo of the corresponding compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that's how others saw it.
Is there any way you can send the lamp back?
As she hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If I can't, I'd be happy with a discount or a coupon.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then something much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna news agency.
This was a "positive and important development" because at first there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalisation of the agreement had been continued after just under a week's interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is higher than the 1000 mark.
Thüringen is the only federal state in the Corona-incidence on Sunday above the mark of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day figure with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had the highest incidence in Germany, this was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously affected by Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly following up with the recording of new cases.
I get that.
Since the delivery takes place only at the beginning of March, it is perhaps possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and leave it at the post office, that's it, right?
here I don't have to click/insert/fill?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is, in my view, an impudence.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not existential.
We have come into a winter rigid and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be linked to dissatisfaction, as some things have happened here and how we are generally presented.
In the last few days, the impression has been shown that many people here still have a good time on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found, simply put, a pile of pieces.
After writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call once again on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed/adapted/removed?
* How are we to appear externally in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's not a bad thing, so we'll end up with the discord.
If you feel like it and have time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clobby for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another suspension from you for that.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also rather sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is there also in excess size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet is picked up promptly.
And I ask you to make this happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet for collection as far as possible - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently probably also rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without thinking much.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal torture.
So my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that on her side there was displeasure, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and was reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without it being put on.
It greets a harmonizing vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my returns on site.
Since I can't be on the spot because of a funeral, it can't be changed either.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a grant notification in the Lahnstein Town Hall of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a long-term expectation of increasing deployments: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for putting yourself in this position, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, that is, we were also carriers of weapons in the executive, and I do not want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of the right and the left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the state servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and weapon bearer people right of conservative magically should also be clear to everyone that these people can of course deal with the lived reality is of course also hard, because you have of course beside the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I mean now not the overly feminine cliché gays, because in the executive there are rather less to not at all, but quite normal men and women who do not notice it if they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, i.e. are proud of Germany, even though it sounds funny to me, and feel rather less taken away by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly works for them or thinks it is right for them to do so, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, because of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that threaten the state is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that especially policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign assignments often begin to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are probably also right-wing contemporaries who have a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, I think that this is being well combated and that it is also being countered by political education and education.
Germany is so very internationally entangled, and that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have proper racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I ordered also on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little leisure time), but for my whole life I get it more bad than right to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it's never really "that someone could come to visit spontaneously."
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere but mostly loses household just against work and displeasure.
The kitchen is cleaned at the most regular as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get better with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we've been working on it, and I've been busy with this question for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitor comes and e.g. always fresh clothes is there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child, or do you remain sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have loose conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (which I think has already become better).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual day-to-day work is really the way I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads in my job to problems (for me, emotional), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("even the easiest things are fucked up") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should know how to do it myself now"/"I keep him off the job with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm undermediated" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to have it mentioned in the place.
But you already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do you mean, give back, please?
If I have downloaded a book to #PRS_ORG#, the message will come your #PRS_ORG# will not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
In its gastrointestinal tract, the bird breaks down the protein (protein) absorbed with the food into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of plumage in the mowing bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal with a particularly high stress.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be problems in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be returned.

1 g of NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A painted measuring spoon (inlay) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the plumage re-formation is visible.
The normal dose is then given until the new plumage is fully formed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Have you received this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee in appeal to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have this problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So application for a fall to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't get a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
yes, I think that's just the question is whether I can pay in euros and get the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that out?
Breaking news: severe traffic accident at Selb

Well, thank you so much again, that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas on further working life
Merry Christmas to you for now!
My Christmas is, unfortunately, moderately good, because my dear head is thinking about everything you can think about.
Before I get here now.. in short: I need advice and best advice from people who somehow know my situation - that is from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-starter.
Originally I studied something else and worked there also in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up at the Magisterium and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job advertisements".
And it's only been six months.
At the time of the painting I always decided to go on and at least finish the Ref, after that I can still turn around.
But just now, I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now it's a vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening off.
That's when I got off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family party is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that also annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the Ref also works well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it closes completely - if it doesn't do that already.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my working life like this - especially if I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area where I was valued, could take my free time when I needed it, and although the work was kind of boring, it was adequately paid for it and worked together in a team and not as a single fighter like this for most of the time.
But then I wonder if I didn't get back to the same place in a year's time as now and I'm dissatisfied.
You see, it's all kind of weird, but maybe as an outsider, you have advice or ideas like how to get out of this situation that I'm completely finished and almost start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the whiny undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously developed, which has led, among other things, to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only sprue.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which has led to a further boost in performance in the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 – with more dynamics as well as more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists will find a maximum variety of sounds.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced playback of playing dynamics and string stop as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that especially the power stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack naturally depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible placement would be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus' MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for other things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
To date, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa at 84 days in 1585.
No reliable data are available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists continued to dare no prognosis as to when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the Insular Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees of hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new promontories with a size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast by cold lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was severely affected, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension have something tempting in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giftgiving, so that the gesture of giftgiving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-building "social contract of natural peoples", escapes from the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christchild
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through which the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Before that, gifts were presented on St. Nicholas' Day in one way or another.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women in her window in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom popular in Germany was to fill the boots, especially of the children, with gifts.
Protestants came up against this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of giving presents shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely anymore, it only bothers the few that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and marching.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giftgiving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giftgiving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian - shaped countries, however, a cheerful Kuddelmuddel predominates over the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who in principle is a kind of Santa Claus, to whom over time some peculiarities have been assigned.
These include, for example, his white Rauschebart, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeers and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame.
It's not reindeer here, it's three horses pulling his sledge as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ child is responsible for the delivery of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by the police on Saturday.
The police said that callers reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots had been fired and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into every bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spears.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Duration of illumination max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in their inner colors.
»Smart Stone«, on the other hand, is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different shades).
The angular, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of time: As a solar luminaire, »Smart Stone« does not need any supply or batteries.
Put the »Leuchtstein« in any place lit by the sun on the day.
Two supplied ground skewers ensure a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dawn, »Smart Stone« begins to shine automatically; in which colour you determine that yourself: You can choose from just six attractive light colours – alongside daylight white.
Switching off also takes place automatically, as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I've done this several times. It doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello, dear women's people,
I hope I do everything right here, is actually my first post after a year reddit.
To my problem: I started to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and fucking PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to let it stay, because I have to take enough medication because of chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years from 0 to 100, I had received explosive pimples and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really put a strain on me and I didn't feel well.
During the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe somebody's got some tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without tins, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, gynaecologist did not take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone: who has read the novel!
Yes, the sweet skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermatitis, then a time rest, then large-scale nodules and the acne theme.
I also tried everything possible in the course of my illness and I got stuck on sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you like me have construction site everywhere you don't want to go looking for more what else goes wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
but there is it in general in large
because it is available in black size

110 kV ground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The permit for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The planning decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for the construction, which is to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk now reported this.
The approximately seven kilometres long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts.
The blue betsell number:#PRS_ORG# with the consignment number #NUMBER# was returned from #PRS_ORG# with the note "Not possible to deliver".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next process is?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass and the entire sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the dresser can't be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment.
Thanks for the message
but why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's with all books, that's why the request is with #PRS_ORG#, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I still have big problems to plan my lessons in the field of geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can basically only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy b/w free of charge (what annoyed for exploration).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and I actually have every hour of my life.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to spend too much time on simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I'm rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe I can get a geography teacher to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I've already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to return as soon as possible.
The trade fears about the 2G rule about Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
Trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains of a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for the retail trade from the point of view of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE).
HDE's Chief Executive Officer, Stefan Genth, criticised the fact that sales in stores with non-day-to-day items were falling.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Thus, traders with 2G access restrictions lost just under a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
It only runs well in the food retail and online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G shopping will not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations discouraged customers and required a high level of staffing.
He demanded that the tape regime be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and had access to all shops with the tape received on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in the retail trade, as already in the public transport sector, under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, with sales at around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, the Centers are trying to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called tape solution, in which "the visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried with a yellow filler to be masked.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it to it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, one of the memory keys is occupied and finished simply by pressing longer.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is again when switching on - Very practical when working with the studio, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with the same built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlight continuously with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlamp is very simple.
You have to attach a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination is to be set reliably on both sides by means of fixers.
It has been taken care that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is included in the scope of delivery also a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a torrich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in Serie Hessen were allegedly on their way to the next Bundesliga broke.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour the frustration shot itself over a mixed season start from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and uttered a "pauschal lob, on every single one who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, who are now in ninth place, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continues.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
The team's morale was also emphasized by defenseman Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field again for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the results especially for the audience.
That was the party we were going to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but is also well positioned in terms of the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also players live highly professional.
Now they want to "continue step by step and remain modest" and to "take over the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week there will be an away match with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o'clock, Sky).
Grad I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect it, not a chance.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would for me then unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women in front of quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball women sneaked off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB-selection in 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers won a hard defeat and now has to compete against host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," Federal coach Henk Groener concluded.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game for all of us to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made next Tuesday against the World Cup second in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was rematch player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted back room player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the high with the kick-off.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 residue after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-strike.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
The German women could hardly stand up against the aggressive cover of the Danes - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since re-space player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and reach at least five goals until the break.
The anyway only quiet hope of a catch-up after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19 gone.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to raise its performance and went off the ground as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in Christmas Time
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have won Santa's Day and take this as an opportunity to devote ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas period, Advent, Santa's, Christmas Eve and Christmas holidays.
How was that at your house back then?
Like your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is most beautiful for the children?
The boot cleaning?
Cookies?
Decorate the tree?
Is it music?
Is Santa coming, the Christ Child, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone tries to have it as nice as possible as a family around Christmas.
Whether these are established traditions, or even something different every year, tell us how it went or is going on in your family!
please send me any transaction number or anything that might help.
Transfer confirmation... etc
I'd like to give you a credit card code

Is that what they're doing?
The title is given, I work as an immunization doctor in mobile vaccination teams where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
As these are soon to a large extent finished, it goes on to some vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions with no time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to one personally (e.g. "I take medication X, can do this with vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility is the information for vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to a vaccination according to Corona vaccination code and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never happened before).
Vaccination itself is delegateable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don't have any, but rather "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, which however cannot carry out vaccinations (may?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR TV show "Wir in Bayern" has provided for intense reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unheard of this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a man who was nervous.
And no one "who needs everything to go quickly".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also caused amazement with many upper Palatinates.
"The Huidler," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewing Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper-Pfalz term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also with some who have been living for a long time in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
The following error message always comes after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice at the road bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of excitement because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove on my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in so every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) lurks.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to join the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with a bad mood and take the first best train home.
Was then also not quite so bad, maybe it is also better, if I practice the tyre change again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would very much not like to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike to 2 p.m. 120km torn off!) and who had already described this as suboptimal, because he with them for several years on role.
But if I think that I have to make a tyre change after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into the conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me wondering why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be unplattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so unchaputtable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tires now, just to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I think I have 25x622 on the road bike right now.
There are also (apparently?) the Marathon Plus tyres, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to use other tyres on a road bike in general?
The Schwalbe-side seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks already in advance for the help and greetings!
Car flings against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had hit a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause and then hit the counterroad, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man trapped in the car.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new talent again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new sprout and is visually reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but is to be reached tonally an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-tone rise.
This is common for widebands in order to optimize the too high frequencies of strongly increasing bundling.
Precisely aligned to the listening place, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-tone range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference-supposed extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that his same seeks.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think at the beginning about the final optics of the loudspeaker, in order to plan corresponding changes in the construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the base plate at the appropriate place, in order to be able to carry out the cable there without any problems.
With the help of a milling machine, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flushly later.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° fase to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the fase, as shown in the picture "Detail Fase".
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are glued.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the thickness of the material if necessary, if one wants to use for example finished bars from the DIY market instead of producing them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a Forstner drill, the openings of the bass reflex tube as well as the connecting clamp on the back wall are easier to attach.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off.
Subsequently, the base plate is glued firmly to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
The following is the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connections of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suck / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In doing so, you push the entire and unshortened cable piece by piece through the 8 mm bore in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable leads to the speaker opening and lets it hang out there as well.
The crossover is prepared and used below.
The crossover construction plan, as well as the corresponding connecting plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal follows the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the dampening follows according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus cable (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For attenuation, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the grid, so we'll be tracking the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we'll give everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
