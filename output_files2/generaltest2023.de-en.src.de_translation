Diego Cocca will become new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca will succeed Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. Until a few days ago, the 50-year-old did not count among the favourites for the position. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November.
Geesthacht: New bed signs to animate for replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blühte auf" also includes information about what is blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blücht auf" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the help of many volunteers from associations, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought to the earth since 2015. Aim: In the Geesthacht city area, large-scale flowering islands are to be created, on which insects can find food at any time. "In favorable weather conditions, the bees fly out already in January to seek food," says Friedhelm Ringe of the Geesthachter Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
In order that the undertaking not only remains an action of nature conservationists and the specialized service environment of the city, but also draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed to the plants. It is about 50 signs up to now. Passers-by should be able to inform themselves in this way, what is blooming here just so beautifully. The hope is that hobby gardeners at home specifically replant.
In the first week of January was already season start at the Wildhasel
Younger dates are shrubs such as winter scented hecks cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have now been stuck in the soil of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, show just the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been considered with further signs. "The winter scented hecks cherry is a very broad bush and can become between two meters high and three meters wide", can be read there under further information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the beds now show flowers. In the first week of January it was already a season start at the Wildhasel. It blooms particularly lushly on the toll road on the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stappen keeps me young"
Munich - Dance God Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of her if he looked down from the sky to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday there at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m., three ladies meet for a brisk tap dance - together they are incredible 277 years old, sadon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Streukner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native of Munich (15 January 1921) of the Schwanthaler Höh" Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dances and steppes are my life without which I cannot imagine".
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) swing their dance legs.
The 97-year-old was rescued in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life with dancing, actors and singing".
With her 79 years of age, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the round of stepper dancers. She says: "We're just having fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: The tap dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the first used wooden soles, in front and back attached to the shoes, rhythmic sounds are created during the dance, which fit the visual impression and the music. The dancer is thus also a percussion musician. The English expression for this is a reverberative tap dance and the French Claquettes. The Spanish flamenco may have influenced the tap dance. The laces of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a good audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a large family, with us are big and small, old and young welcome".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol".
Analog in dialogue - The limits of the digital
As digitalisation progresses, the desire for analogues is growing again with so many
The speed with which our everyday life became digital left us hardly time to set rules for dealing with it and adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three possibilities. Either you were one of the six percent lucky people who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a phone call for a bottle of Radeberger with the relatives there. Or you went to a telephone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the plastic earpiece and the click of the small money coins in the vending machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the other when calling - picture telephony, I thought, what a great thing it would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also Moldova), President Maia Sandu appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had resigned surprisingly. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her demission - apparently she was opposed by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighbouring country of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has received tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority because it occupies 63 out of 101 seats. Confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian – with the support of the Kremlin – have become more popular.
Those were the costumes of the celebrities
2023 is celebrated again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrity did not take long to ask.
His father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which makes his costume suspect. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of Bavaria. At his side wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franken came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and Mrs Anja.
Completely detached: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, draws it into space.
Landtag president Ilse Aigner did not find anyone less than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In Peace-and-Love mode: Bavarian Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and wife Birgit.
Bob der Baumeister alias Bauminister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's Goldjunge: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff in carnival: Bavaria's interior minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side wife Gerswid.
At the Walz: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, Landrätin des Kreiss Regensburg, does it like him.
Of course, the political opposition should not be missing either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green faction leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-chief Ludwig Hartmann as Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD leader Lust: Florian von Brunn with SPD chairman Ronja Endres.
Royal it was with FDP leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise he will certainly speak more. In Veitshöchheim, the group chairman in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime.
If politics no longer works, he can still conjure up. Nuremberg's OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
Flott on the road as a bee: Bavaria's digital minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, the BR director Katja Wildermuth and the BR cultural programme director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side blow against the climate activists by Frankish crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed either. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn Achter in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic winner has already collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to join his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, which is on site as a TV expert, is still undisputed record champion with 20 World Cup gold medals. Even partly strong fog did not prevent permanent champion Bö from collecting his second gold on the race track. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay had already been successful in defending the title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the pursuit Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so that he can easily compensate for shooting errors to some extent frighteningly.
In the meantime, there was nothing going on at Doll. Three days later, after the Routinier had given a penalty round in the mixed relay all the chances for a medal at the start and had only finished sixth, it didn't go any better. Three penalty rounds already standing in reclining shooting and two more were a great disappointment for the elder in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen he won surprisingly with 0.7 seconds advantage ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes that Dolls had been on the podium this winter. Beijing's Olympic Eighth left without a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place and second World Cup debut David Zobel finished in 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
U.S. President Joe Biden visited his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for the preservation of democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations was put to the test," Biden said in the White House in Washington on Friday. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that make up the core of our strength." Lula replied with regard to his right-wing official Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
Lula, the left-wing politician, had won a run-off election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1st. The change of power was accompanied by heavy riots. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court, and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a gloomy reminder of the storm of the U.S. Capitol a good two years ago, in which supporters of then President Donald Trump forcibly invaded the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," said Lula. "Come to know," Biden replied - an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone else remember the RAF arrest warrants? They saw the members of the Red Army faction released for denunciation and firing.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, there was such a public atmosphere, against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say the late capitalist society. (Here nothing to the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually rather after Raudis in the suburbs or onanists in the park, gives a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world there are perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not what it's about, but: Mrs. Wagenknecht is at number one to five (!) and then Mrs. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I don't know anyone around me who reads this sheet. If it is, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level where nothing is below.
And at the latest now, well dialectical, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And now no differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler submits divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild"-Zeitung and RTL in the same wording. There it says: "I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has submitted to the competent court an application for the annulment of his life partnership.
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, there have been separation rumors for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have moved from the common house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also talked about marriage problems in the RTL show.
SS massacres in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In 1999, a memorial centre was set up in the destroyed village north-west of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, said Macron. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for Franco-German youth encounters.
A corner position for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ-Serie Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien not infrequently three, four generations live under one roof. Here the inhabitants find Idylle pure. In summer also sometimes 300 motorcycles per day the curvy route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup long - and some also immediately back.
German bank head Christian Sewing considers further interest rate increases necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate to be "absolute". "The inflationary risks are still high. The cost of energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also temporarily boost prices," said Sewing of the "world on Sunday".
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) had raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive year, with the prospect of a further 0.5 percentage points increase for the meeting on 16 March. Euro area key interest rates are now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates increase the price of loans. This can slow down demand and counteract such high inflation rates. Higher interest rates can also lead to a postponement of investment and thus lower economic growth.
"The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we have to keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
In the medium term, the ECB is aiming for price stability for the euro area at a inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far removed for months. Although price growth weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for a euro. Strongly increased energy prices, which drive inflation decisively, are also a burden for businesses.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "break down sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also President of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I see this as the greatest danger for the German economy at the moment. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Tempo" announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) on infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about this. And he may also be a bit more controversial," he said to the German press agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that a set of rules will come out at the end, with which it will not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year - but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) had been opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new "Germany-Tempo". In addition, the Federal Government had recently launched an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"For the first time, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it comes to it. However, this should not automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and, for example, place a windmill in the garden against the neighbour's will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must still be a negotiation process, which one finds right and wrong as a society.
In the past, the classic rules had been tried and not managed. "We should think again about whether the previous procedure was the right one. Maybe we also exaggerated it with the rules and made it too complicated".
In view of the many open tasks he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, for example when expanding the power lines, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Trade union warns against the destruction of the Bayer Group
The IG BCE Chemicals Union warns of the destruction of the Group after an announced change of head at Bayer. "From the point of view of the employees, Bayer is perfectly positioned with its three pillars for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, member of the board of the union and Bayer Supervisory Board, the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This is the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health division with non-prescription drugs and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry is only managed with a corporate policy based on risk dispersion and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change of head of the pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will leave the post this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical chief of the Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is due to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been critical. The acquisition of US seed manufacturer Monsanto, completed in 2018, for 63 billion dollars is subject to the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkuseners had brought expensive litigations for alleged cancer risks of the weed destroyer Glyphosate into the house. Bayer's share was on a sinking flight for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to grant discharge to the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
For a long time, it was known that Baumann was not aiming for an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Pressure had been exerted by long-term strategic investors. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, were also involved.
The very small fund with an unknown shareholding in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A split-off "the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post". However, he does not consider it possible to split off the far larger Crop Science agricultural division.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing a government project to the concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again against the pension reform on Saturday.
On Saturday in France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the trade unions are mobilising against the plans of the middle government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. Twice, more than a million people have been on the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. Over the controversial reform, there has been a turbulent debate in parliament for a week.
Many people in France are already working longer than they were until the age of 62, if they have not yet paid long enough for a claim-free pension when they reach the age limit. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work longer, the opponents of the reform mean. Moreover, the employees wanted to enjoy their well-earned pension and not completely wear out their health in the job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension funds
Macron explains the reform with an imminent deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the employees with their contributions would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners. In order to keep the amount of the pension stable, the population had to work a little more. Critics doubt the calculations of the government and demand that the state had to find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
However, the government does not want to screw up only at the retirement age. The increase in the required payment period for a full pension, which had already been decided years ago, is to be accelerated. Furthermore, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered to be one of the most important projects of President Macron. During the Corona pandemic a first attempt to implement the reform was stopped, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Already many presidents before Macron tried with varying success for reforms of the French pension system - broad protest and strikes were certain to everyone.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to carry through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, which announced support. However, some of the Members - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a tight vote at the moment, Macron is likely to be concerned about paralyzing strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the President said that he could count on the responsibility of the organizers so that they would be quiet and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - in high altitudes lots of sun
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that there is plenty of sunshine to be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least up to mid-week. "When looking at weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately stands in the eye over Central Europe", explains meteorologist Markus Böse from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high is moving a little to the east over the next week, it still determines the weather in Germany".
However, quiet high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Ebel. " Such a high can even be quite mean and give the people in the lowlands dreary high fog grey for days, while in the high altitudes of the middle mountains there is pure sun".
According to DWD, Sunday starts in most regions foggy and cloudy. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it can still rain a little. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up during the day and the sun appears more and more frequently. In the rest of the country it remains heavily cloudy or highly foggy covered. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually stronger sun is nibbling at the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more during the day," says the meteorologist. On the Alpine edge, in the high altitudes of the low mountains and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day long, elsewhere it has to fight through the high fog cover. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine are 11 degrees, on the other hand, in the permanent grey in the southeast only 3 degrees are expected.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands, there can be only tough resolution of fog or high fog again. Otherwise, the weather is cheerful after fog resolution. In high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps, the sun seems to be shining all day long. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominatorin hates: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
After her departure in the downhill of the alpine ski world championships, the beaten Toppotavoritin Sofia Goggia proved to be very disappointed.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't deliver the performance I can," said the Italian woman in the ZDF after she had set up a goal and left. After all, the 30-year-old was able to prevent a possible serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill player in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six season races in this discipline. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, known for her risky driving style, has to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. At her home match in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was absent due to injury.
"I actually thought I was good at it. It was a hundredth of a second," Goggia said after the surprising victory of the Swiss woman Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that all experts expected and ultimately missed: "But they're not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10th.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn Station. Police are asking for clues about her whereabouts.

Selenskyi and Minister against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint conference call, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport had agreed to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, said the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė said.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of the UK. It had been a very productive meeting, British sports minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I have made the UK's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now make a joint statement on this issue".
Formerly, Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyy had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Selenskyy said. He published his speech in his telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag is ultimately soaked with blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a war party because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selenskyy called on the officials to defend the Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which unfortunately lost its "honesty".
The occasion for the conference was the announcement of the IOC to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine also threatens to boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, subsequently stated that it had also confirmed during the discussions that it would reject a start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to have full solidarity and support from the international sports community. The IOC's desire to resume Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," said a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior on a dpa request.
Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in his condemnation of the brutal war Putin waged against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in the airless space." Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated.
At present, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under neutral flag, provided that they are clearly committed to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or the place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.

"Hey, horny butt!", whistling after the fool in a tight sexy costume and shouting out an insidious saying: All this falls under the concept of "Catcalling". Behind the term is no less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public space.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA see Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? USA see Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. We are talking about the "half of the main stock".
According to US Department of Defense estimates, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to the US assessment at an online event of the Denkfabrik Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is expected to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has pledged to supply Challenger 2 battle tanks for March. Germany plans to deliver a battalion to Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The USA has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kreml chief Dmitri Medvedev proposed the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging abroad for planes, missiles, tanks," said Medvedev, who is now Vice-Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks".
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more focused on the needs of the army, for example by requiring individual industries to supply the armed forces.
Whirlpool for post-occupation with army
The post, which the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in future, was not advertised. The personnel representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects that post corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
According to the Minister, a tender was not required because the appointment was made for a previously vacant job. "Speculations of a free representative of personnel" she did not want to comment on. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's dealings with the military past of Austria, he was confronted with heavy bullying charges.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability for content. He is an expert in the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands information from Tanner about the "unusual order process". The decision is based on the "appointment of Postenschacher", says SPÖ spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP "continues to the neck of the corruption swamp", said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees before costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to keep to the traditional carnival parade in contrast to the state capital. However, the higher costs for safety, among other things, are difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The funds alone made up about half of the calculated total cost of the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "train of the happy people" in Cottbus, probably again East Germany's largest, takes place for the first time after the pandemic. Even during the Swabian-Alemannic carnival no parades were cancelled.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne holds on to the traditional move despite the increased costs. "We are going through our event", says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But here too, the financial worries are pressing: If no more sponsors were found or the previous ones even more assigned, reserves would have to be damaged - "this is not possible every year". The deficit currently: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: there is a price increase of up to 60 percent for confectionery, says Elvira Reuther of the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Due to luck in the accident, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear for the move that it will be more expensive. For security, twice as much personnel is needed than in 2020.
If you're standing on the Rosenmontag train in the Rhineland on the roadside, you could get less camels than you used to. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants don't have that much. Kamelle back or forth, the visitor crowd is likely to be big: "I think if it doesn't rain out of cue on the day, then we can expect an increased crowd," says Cologne train leader Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that two years no regular Rosenmontag train has taken place. The train is of course not to be replaced by anything."
At the expense, the Festkomitee in Cologne does not express itself in detail. However, the train is generally "deficitful", which is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and the Second Burned Vodka
The Ukrainians are not considered to be drinking-proof for nothing. There are local beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can see no big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widely used. They burn it here above all on the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. How much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics exactly nobody knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption fell by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here as well how little one can believe the Russians. It means that one should be careful with it as a tourist. But that only applies if he goes into the mass sale.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Matchschlück on our side"
Food and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer for the end of the day, Rostock and Warnemünde will find great places for this. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the annealing for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favorites win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweeper master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flake"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Cup sprint of Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
As much as the Federal President made an effort, from the grandstand of honour, it was impossible to see whether the windows on the shooting track really fell. "I had to get the results over my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier smiled and referred to the fog swaths that were repeatedly moving into the stadium, which greatly affected the view on the race track for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit of the 10-km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, the biathlon fascinates me," he also revealed and praised Oberhof for his modernised sports facilities: "The retreaded arena is great and offers ideal conditions. This is also what the athletes say - thanks to those who have been working here since the World Cup was awarded." Also in terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" and thus "safe for the next years and even decades".
The Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö hurried out of the competition once again. Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Cup title in Oberhof. Behind him his error-free shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
One day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph, the local ski hunters could not intervene in the battle for the medals. Johannes Kühn took eighth place as best German after a shooting mistake and a delay of 1:04.8 minutes. World Cup debut Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and became 12th (1:14.6). Two glances behind the grey veil. Benedikt Doll again disappointed. After his mischievous mixed use on Wednesday, the Black Forest left five slices and disappeared as 55th deeply disappointed and uncommented in the cabin.
Bö had entered the race before 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visual conditions. However: In his last two standing shots he had the luck of the addict; they each landed on the edge of the windows and fell nevertheless. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: "It is the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the persecution on Sunday. However, the German hopes for Herrmann-Wick rest with the women. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to get in as tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one", took sport director Felix Bitterling his "locomotive" into the obligation. The organizers expect for the double event (13.25 and 15.30/ZDF and Eurosport live) a nearly sold out arena.
Brych displeases "Bee Swarm" on the square
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on referee ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsports. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
German top arbitrator Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in co-operation on the playing field. "I think there are new behaviors of the players who, after decisions, encircle the referee a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We decided that we do not want to accept such unsports. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it."
The coach Bo Svensson from Mainz had seen the red card at the trophy defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund Gelb-Rot. "The coach's behaviour also falls into the field of unsports. We noticed that unsports have also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsports", said Brych.
DFB Judge-in-Chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a fundamentally good cooperation between trainers and impartials. "Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The affected person has to live with it. This should not be anything world-moving," said Fröhlich of the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can well lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if emotionality is flooded into a personal denigration, then one must also accept that the corresponding measures are taken by the referee side," said Fröhlich. In the recent cases, the participants would have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be important if an overall rethinking process would come into being that such behaviour simply did not belong," said Fröhlich on the margins of an event by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on another level. "Of course, events from professional football always color off. There is a role model effect, resulting in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees consistently reacted to negative behaviors," said Fröhlich. "Independence from the consistent rule interpretation in the game is always helpful to clarify, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and the affected parties."
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach
After a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometre long cross-country skiing race of the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro, the victory was secured by the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia was third.
The German combiners are not in the best position in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing themselves with training in Oberstdorf for the world championships, which take place from 21 February to 5 March in Planica in Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said Bundestrainer Hermann Weinbuch in ZDF.
Seven Slightly Injured after A5 Incident
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident with four vehicles on motorway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a police report, the accident occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed it onto two more cars. The full lock of the lanes towards Heidelberg had been lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage in the Marler Sculpture Museum
Launched the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition ends at the Marler Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage for the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarter of the Marler Sculpture Museum in Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. Two large-format murals each attract attention in three exhibition rooms.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over and the works of art disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art at the service of the community on the occasion of the Finissage. Using numerous examples of paintings, she presents the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connecting lines to this art genre in the Federal Republic with a focus on the NRW from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate in 2013 on wall painting in the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching post-war art and institution history in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art at construction in NRW. After the lecture, the last curator's tour of the exhibition takes place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is a question of building defects that have encouraged the collapse of buildings: in the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible building defects after building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, 33 people have been arrested, reports the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing persecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for building defects that have favored the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the Adana Public Prosecutor's Office is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. 62 arrest warrants have been issued in the course of this investigation so far. According to information provided by Anadolu, one of the accused was arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, reports Anadolu. Nine more people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early on Monday morning, a 7th earthquake had shaken the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7th earthquake at noon. More than 7500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Hans Modrow, East Germany's penultimate Prime Minister, died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left-wing faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on the night of Saturday. Group chairman Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night, "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," the leftist faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party thus "lose a significant personality," explained the group leader Dietmar Bartsch and the former group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district management of the SED in Dresden. As prime minister he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Wall, on 13 November 1989, he became chairman of the GDR Council of Ministers - for about 150 days. In the popular chamber elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was the last prime minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The leader of the left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow as a "deeply sincere and militant socialist" in a message on the short news service Twitter. Bartsch added:
"Until old age he was an important advisor to our party, whose wisdom will be lacking."
"The entire peaceful process of making German unity was a special merit of him. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary.
"His later work in the Volkskammer, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS was always to represent also that part of the former GDR population, which was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After the reunification, Modrow served for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow saw the new state "fully critical". German unity had been carried out too quickly, the GDR had perished too unconditionally, and it had been condemned as an "unrighteous state" too unilaterally, according to dpa, Modrow had criticized in many interviews.
What happened at night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Selenskyi condemns Russian rocket attacks. However, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs on the power grid.
Kiev - The recent wave of Russian rocket attacks again forces emergency repairs on the Ukrainian energy grid. But Ukraine also attacks Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudrytskyy, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. Particularly bad looks at the power supply in the Kharkiv area. Because of instability in the Ukrainian electricity grid a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytsky nuclear power station, in the nuclear power plants Rivne and South Ukraine production was throttled.
President Wolodymyr Selenskyy condemned the Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had experienced during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyi does not want to abandon the small town of Bachmut
US President Joe Biden announced a visit to the important Ukrainian supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger of Russian rocket attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital city of Kiev, air alarms were triggered for the fifth time on Friday evening for this day. "There is an attack with drones," said the military administration of the Kiev area. Fight drones of Iranian construction were also sighted and shot down over the Mykolayiv and Odessa areas in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
The coalition partner SPD failed to demand, among other things, that the FDP and the Greens split these out of the election campaign. The coalition agreement agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which should, however, be of general interest in the future. In other words, it does not need to generate and make profits.
Renovation dam of 80 billion euros
The two consulting companies are intended to help the federal government to accompany this process. Renovation of the rail network is an essential reason why the railway is currently running very untimely. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this maladministration with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments that are necessary for this have been estimated at 50 billion euros so far. However, according to recent calculations by the railway, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me?"
The external circumstances had obviously not spoken for Herrmann-Wick. She had slept badly, she told after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse had not come down even when starting. "Such a race", and that at the home world championship, "you can't describe that with words," she said. 11,000 spectators were jolting at the roaring hit music with German flags, supervisors and team fell into their arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", she had planned
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old was the biggest, if not the only German medal hope to start the world championship apart from the seasons. Herrmann-Wick was the only German to win two World Cups this winter. She currently ranks fifth in the overall World Cup. And even though the power density of the women in the top is significantly higher than for the men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, there were others on the note for this sprint victory after all.
Criticism of the Government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been tense since 2018. At that time demonstrators who demanded Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. In the protests in 2018 more than 350 people had died. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow it.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special assets
The first arms projects have therefore already been cancelled, and further projects threaten the same as the "world on Sunday" reports. However, what investments would fall away in concrete terms cannot be said at the moment. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings already at the present time," says the Federal Government in response to a request from the Bundestag member Ingo Gädechen (CDU).
The fall in the investment amount is due to rising interest rates. The special assets financed entirely by credit, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans themselves. If these are increased, less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Copper Cell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10 February-11 February), around 01.40 hrs., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive on the motorway at the motorway exit Kupferzell to the left in the direction of Heilbronn. At this time a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 towards Künzelsau, as the police reported. At the turn-off of the BMW driver there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both accident participants stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic lights revealed no objection. Further investigations followed. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger were each slightly injured in the BMW. They had to be taken to a hospital. At the two cars a damage of approximately 20,000 euros was caused.
Schlossplatz Stuttgarter commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib-Moscheegemeinde on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. There is great sympathy - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria affects the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people thought and prayed for the victims at Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had followed the call of the Ditib-Moschee community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened seriously and silently to the Imam's prayer. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. He asked, among other things, for health, protection from plagues and respectful relations with each other. The community also asked for help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib is at the side of the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German at Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already been collected during the donation campaign of the German Islam Association Türisch-Islamische Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in the Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with meat inlay - Ebersberg
"After the meal you should rest or take a thousand steps".... The elderly know the saying, the younger just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic the good, old digestive walk experienced an unimagined renaissance. Because, thanks to home office, who does not sit in the middle of a stone desert, but rather a stone's throw away from the field, forest and meadow, now uses the lunch break either after the fast snack in front of the screen or immediately substituted for a walk to the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around the Egglburger lake, where between 12 and 14 o'clock not only dog owners stroll.
One reason could of course also lie in the fact that the human being of modern times can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of an optimal time slot use. Because why not on the occasion of a short march through nature from the long-unseen neighbour learn news from the settlement? Or the girlfriend, with which you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? Also in this way professional and private life could be connected - who says that the appointment with tax consultant, lawyer or investment consultant can not take place outdoors? If no foreign ears are nearby, of course.
What can also be done excellently is the purchase of natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, that stands on a table at the side of the road. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid only if you have not already thought about the purchase in advance and made appropriate arrangements. Thus an older couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in the voice. "Unfortunately, we have forgotten the money".
The disappointment can be felt, but you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. Whatever you let know the sympathetic chance acquaintance. What the man responds to: "That's not true! You have a bag with you very well!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which you quickly threw over before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an extra headgear unnecessary. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one starts the way back with meat insert and on this midday short trip not only around a lamb's ridge, but also a very practical idea has become richer. Well possible that on this day a second walk is due - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Tightened and badly injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the roundabout towards Hailfingen and came from an unexplained cause in a left turn to the right of the road, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a lead post, bounced sideways against a tree and stopped a few meters away. Due to the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. The rescue service brought the seriously injured to a hospital. As there was suspicion of inability to drive, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, total damage to the Audi was incurred in the amount of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's Tax Documents: Point for the Rule of Law
The U.S. Department of Justice has decided that the tax authorities must hand over the tax returns of the ex-president to the parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of President of the USA
The Ministry of Finance had to instruct the IRS tax authority to issue the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the Ministry's decision of Friday.
In contrast to political practices in the United States, real estate entrepreneur Trump had made his tax return public neither as a candidate nor later as a president. He resisted publication until the Supreme Court. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
The publication to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: there the circle of the entitled to access is slightly larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. Moreover, confidential matters from the parliament also repeatedly penetrate outwards.
The chairman of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and his erosion of our security as president," Pelosi said.

British heavy criminal caught after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from Great Britain was arrested in Thailand. As the British criminal police NCA reported on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police officers in a car workshop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the criminals most wanted by the NCA.
According to the authorities, the leader of a criminal group fled before the start of a trial in early 2018, in which he was sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Meetings at the church table

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and who, according to his own evidence, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. This fits the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again". Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic science scepticism is to be put aside.
By the way, the English-language title also derives from Ebert's younger life story, since in 2019 he tried to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year. Now, however, he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences overseas, but also explains what knowledge aft actually is and what she can't do and what above all does not. Corona, of course, also appears there, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering art.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people are pushing before him: What is really important? All with a huge wink of the eye, unobtrusive and very ironic. And so not only are entertained well, but can also learn something about it.

General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tanker driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley plain are rock pyramids and rock quadres, which offer the player preliminary protection, because they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving chain vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as fast rockets, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended play run. In addition, UFO's appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by a UFO hit. The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction run, the game initiation run, the game abl on, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test run. The latter mode represents a special procedure for checking the controls and the computer function.
4th Game Play
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is activated. The LED switch remains illuminated and the playing sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is finished. The game starts with slow moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles can be determined by the player by observing the displayed text in the upper left indicator angle of his cockpit. An indication may be e.g.: GEGNER OF RIGHTS. In addition, on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a Sonar BLIP tone, a point that represents the enemy position is visible.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is well positioned on the screen. Furthermore, GEGNER is displayed in the upper left indicator display at the same time.
In the meantime, UFO's become visible on the screen, which fly over the battlefield. These are dangerous missiles that observe the combat activity and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be captured by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the battle action and distract the player, as these normally appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the opponent's tank. A shooting by the player brings 5,000 points to this. If an opponent is hit, the following points are reached: For a slow-moving tank 1,000 points, for a rocket 2,000 points and for a super tank 3,000 points. A super tank drives and spins twice as fast as the player's tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the player the opportunity to use a game sequence 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, the frequency of the rocket selections are freed for more difficult shooting positions.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the top score table, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that with the triggering of a self-test, the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or an interruption of the net voltage, the table with the highest scores will be deleted. When deleting (RESET) the ten (10) highest scores with their initials will be received and re-registered on the screen to challenge more players. Each score over 100,000 will be additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer will enter auto-matic strokes.
1. New parts
The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with video devices from ATARI, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI switch lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer body part, which makes this unit more stable and ensures proper function of the switch contacts. Another change is the centering bellow made of rubber, which, like a centring spring, brings the control lever back to the center position. The microscalders are now, for easier replacement, attached with self-locking nuts. B. Two PC boards. Atari's X/Y game circuit was extended to two (2) connected boards. These are the analog Vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen with a higher speed, which has a uniform and quiet image to follow. C. The power supply is provided with a more powerful power supply unit, which now has a larger power supply.
These new components, as well as all other main components of this device are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready for play. Nevertheless, you should carry out a certain check to complete the quality control. In order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Device not yet connected to the 220 V network. A. Examine case outside for damage. B. Open the device's maintenance flap and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all harness connectors for correct and fixed connection. Connect any open or loose connectors to each other.
NOTE: Never forcibly establish plug connections. The plugs are equipped with a forced guide so that a correct connection is established. A 180 degree twisted plug connection destroys the PCB.
(2) Plug connections to the game PC board check for correct and fixed seat. (3) Note the production number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check whether the punched production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number is located on the back of the cover sheet of this manual. This number should always be indicated when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) All other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor check for proper installation. (5) Closed, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. With a view through the player's viewing glass it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also in the bright orange-coloured opening of the panel. If the opening is not exactly centered, then the panel mounted on the housing must be solved and re-arranged. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, the power supply must be checked.
HAVE YOU PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most of the problems related to current DirectX games. Check system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. Use the DirectX Diagnostic Program to get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements. Please do the following to access the DirectX Diagnostic Program: Click the "Start" button and select the "Execute" option. Enter the "dxdiag" text box. Now, the DirectX Diagnostic Program user interface will be displayed. Here, you will have access to all relevant system details, including graphic and sound card information. You can check, among other things, whether graphics and sound work properly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Program. Before starting the game, please check whether your system meets the requirements listed on the package.
It may happen that other programs are installing the system resources that the game requires to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious that they are active, and many are automatically launched when the system starts up. Such programs that are constantly active on their system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they may be the cause of your program's hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you stop such background applications before you start the game. - If you run antivirus or crash guard programs on your system, you should close them or disable them before you start the game. Seek the icon of the program in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the corresponding option ("Deactivate" "Close" or similar). - Once you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also stop general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. More about this can be found in the section "How to exit all unnecessary background applications".
Before installing software, it must be ensured that your hard drive works optimally. Therefore, you should make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need are provided with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation and disk cleaning to make everything run smoothly. Then, there are great chances that current games on your PC will run largely smoothly. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you still use will run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to find out about the tools ScanDisk or error testing, defragmentation and disk cleaning. The use of Windows help
1. Click the "Start" button and select "Help" (or "Help and Support" option) to access the Windows Help. 2. Now click on the Search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Check" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive a guide explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card, so you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, try to download the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTION WORDS ON FARMS
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression that allowed me to push the world to its limits. It represented a way for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with the still unripe technique, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything was still to be discovered - especially a new language, which had to be both narrative and visual. To be quite honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games used only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too much of "action" and overly forgot a fundamental element of the human world of experience: the sensations. Meanwhile, the technology continued to make rapid progress. Driving represented my contribution to making video games a true means of communication, but also being offered to make the most of the truth of the truth. create that is not only based on fighting in dark corridors against heinous monsters and shooting on crates to get ammunition, but on far more sophisticated and deeper content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer a game content without sacrificing the narrative or the interactive elements. I hope that both gamers and casual players will have fun in this new game experience. If you're more skeptical about video games, I hope that driving will help to change your attitude in this regard. In the past two years, driving has filled up a large part of our lives and enriched it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in our children's shoes and offers the chance to discover everything. In the past two years, driving has filled up a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we have always seen ourselves as being forced to discover many of the principles that remain unresolved, leaving me with a lot of joy when I leave a song in front of you.

We ask you to carefully observe the instructions of this manual in order to ensure satisfactory function of the machine.
The information and figures contained in this SERVICE MANUAL correspond to the state of the art at the time of printing. CHANGES IN THE SINCE OF THE TECHNICAL PROGRESS REQUIREMENTS, NOT A DEPARTMENT! Please note at the list
Transport damage
As far as external transport damage is visible, these must be objected immediately, held on a transport note and confirmed by the supplier (shipper, federal railway, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage!
For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to the VDE regulation, the device is equipped with a protective conductor connection and is intended only for dry rooms. Non-invasive working of the coin system requires horizontal and vertical positioning of the device. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor at any time, please switch off the machine for a short time (pull the power plug) and on again. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Before repair pull power plug! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch voltage leading parts! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still cause dangerous voltage. ATTENTION,HOOK PAN! At the anode connection of the picture tube there are about 20000 volts. Replace fuses only with those with the same values! A burned-out fuse signals overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced by a higher quality, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections with the device on. SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (at minimum credit 2) for 2 players. It has to be tried to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the moving SPARX. The game sequence is set so that a minimum required area must be taken before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX is displayed by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX is released. In case of alarm, the SPARX becomes SUPER-SPARX and agressive. If, as long as you try to draw your area, your marker is turned into the death spiral, it will be destroyed as you cannot cross your own path or return. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, an ignition line will be plugged and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow sign speed, the points will be doubled. After opening the control console, the 4 programming and test switches are available.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls work flawlessly. For more information see "Service Program". The volume can be done at the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

The credits per coin are set to the "injection slot programming" ad. High score program ad (highest response rate until now). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the 10 next scores. The values are used to set to highscore selected on the previous ad (set from "back"). By pressing the "up" switch, the initials QIX standard are set. With pressure on the "test" switch, the next program ad appears. The "overall evaluation". By pressing the "up" switch can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total Credit: The number of paid credits. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts from the front. The total number can only appear to 0 if the battery or the credit connection W1 is removed, when the credit is switched off. Left side coins: Number of - in the left coin slot - cast coins. Medium Coins: (non-existent) Right side of the coin is given to the number of coins - Number of credits - Number of credits are given to the credit.
High Score (Result Rate): Number where one player had enough high score to push other players out of the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, a default coin setting can be selected from the display or another setting can be programmed
If a default setting is specified, then the default setting is set by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches the programming, while the top digit turns green on the screen. The size values change with changing the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switches the setting is taken. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the default setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After one-time printing, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that one's own setting is possible. As the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and only changes the values that are not appropriate. Once the setting is done, a "Sub-Test" switch can be selected by pressing any new setting. If unwollen pressing shows the default setting. With the "Up" and "Down" switches, a value can be increased or reduced before the value is given.
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in dom all programmings are stored, failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default setting. This state probably indicates failure or error of the battery.
INVESTMENT INQUIRY AND SETTLEMENTS
Start of the test method. All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display, the next program will be displayed by pressing the "Test" switch. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test starts in the auto test mode. In this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. If the display "Open Coin Door to Test" (open coin door for testing) appears, the program connector J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. If the connector J 19 is withdrawn, the memory (storage) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = from / I = one / X = test results
The ROM check sum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum saved for this ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LED's. If the checksum ROM is wrong, U 10 will be displayed first. If this test does not succeed, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug (26-0002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732).
The Communications RAM test determines the functionality of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt holds with the display above, an error was detected. If the Communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or error in the data board. To locate the error, remove data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Error in U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video board CMOS RAM
After values have been inscribed in another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test has been passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device holds with the above display, there is an error. Check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding in this case.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers follow when reading back for accuracy. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by inscribing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to hold and the LED's indicate the faulty RAM. If an display RAM fails, detect the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LED's), it will show that the next check is started (Data Hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be functional.
Regrettably dislodged
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for Star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without recognizable seam defects. BUT I looked forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it should sit so tight and I did not want to fight at my upper width into an S or M. In the end it would have been fit from the length and on the hip...in the rest I could swim. In addition, the lining material came to one already when opening the package and spread everywhere. Simply a pity. It is sent back :/
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it well from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally enthusiastic. She usually wears the 158 and she fits the 36 in this case quite well and will certainly be worn the next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the truck lifter and that is not optimal. Unfortunately I measured myself and the pad does not quite fit. But what my mistake is. I changed something to make it fit. The pad looks very robust and you can not damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or the whole surface. It worked without any problems. It does not slip any more. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product in itself I quite ok, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is still much too large for the small mouth. We fetched it when our son was 7 months and he could not use it for the sake of size. Now at 12 months we have looked him out again and he can use it. Has also nothing on biting with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calms him very much.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately goes back
I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker, but I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker. I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker. I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker, but I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker. I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker, I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker. I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker, I did not want to spend a lot of time with the backpacker, I have already bought the sigma 70-200 2.8. I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack then came back yesterday, the sobering: the backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, but that can not be said. But that he (as written in many reviews) with the well-known products which are sold to far higher prices, I have decided to keep up with the other ones.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far I had liked the electric series of E. L. Todd best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and recommended and had really looked forward very much to the third part. In the part is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily long. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and is then with every fight like a little child and gets lost?! At the same time there were also inconsistencies, my feeling, because at the end of the second part, Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said that Taylor would stand on him and try to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't without him and he heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part Volt seems to have forgotten everything and struggled for Taylor. I had hoped that this was the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest again and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out, the Taylor's girlfriend Sarah the Ex would bring the tension into the story.
Man destroys everything, doesn't appreciate anything and doesn't learn to do it! First of all: Sooo is not bad now, how many write it. Sure, of course, the story is totally constructed, and again and again according to the same scheme F. When you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and doesn't appreciate anything, and doesn't learn to do it! And that's exactly what the movie wants to say to us! How many times have I just thought about the movie (and that although I know it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, you often already shoot tears in your eyes. From that's why Jurasic World The fallen kingdom is really neatly made. It's just a pity that man just doesn't rave the message behind the movie, and that, although it's a mainstream movie. We destroy consistently, the animal and the environment and the finale our planet and us too. Out of greed, and out of stupidness and arrogance Empathie! But the environment is made for the same movie.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be it. This FIlm is above all "French" - besides, he is calm, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and makes you cry - if you let yourself in on him and don't expect anything from him that he doesn't want to be at all.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a package: nothing moved, but nothing at all. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Flattening like never before! After diarrhoeas 5-8 times daily. Little helpful, unfortunately despite immediate cessation the diarrhea has been for 1 week. It is to be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately only seen too late), with the larger full 5? That is very strange!
I dyed my blond hair in October with an intense tint into a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I used the product twice. The first time I noticed that it smells terrible! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out in about chestnut brown (somewhat darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instruction even with not satisfied result. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't matter, my hair looked like in the first attempt. What was the worst, it still smelled weeks after the application. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell simply didn't disappear.
Very recommendable
I take the tablets for a long time and always take a tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been longer in the basement because of my work, too little exercise and even a longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating healthy food but also by taking vitamins D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed. The price is also great because you have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
After 3 months of use of the battery case I discovered the following gross defects which I feel very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with the time to "connect" with the mobile phone. This means that it is no longer charged even though the "Power On/Off" button has been activated for 3 seconds. If you remove the phone from the case and install it again you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, however, this creates a new deficiency. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the phone into the case the cover is now so worn out that it dissolves itself from the case, which is why I would have almost lost it several times. These are not many gross defects, however, I find that a battery case should work properly in its function and therefore, for the cost of 30€, I am very disappointed about the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all this good rating comes to pass. In the end, it's actually a spectacle cleaning cloth, which you get with every optician in a slightly smaller form gift. The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and not better. I promised myself much more of these cloths it's also really very thin. Since I used it I can't exchange it anymore I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far covered more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower, when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately got broken. Basically the Onforu works great, is waterproof (me shcon fell into the shower), gives bass like bass again, Bluetooth works great... Suction cup you have to water naturally, otherwise it dissolves.. it can play sound very loud... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is played as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals are almost blowing in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are quite audible enough. My old speaker did not play bass well as bass, but the frequencies were shown quite naturally in the volume. Unfortunately, with Onforu this is not really what I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to pull off a star. I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
At a few places the color was chipped off and if you just went over with the hand the color went right away to some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. they would only exchange the damaged parts but like if both chest of drawers was damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and transferred us the money back. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which makes itself felt in the quality. Items that have to be glued together are delivered. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman stuffed the product downright into my mailbox a few templates were damaged. I did not criticize it, because I urgently needed this product. The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but adheres to it properly - like chewing gum which does not get hard. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least this 5 days after gluing was still not dry), one has to be very careful that not everything is glued together. The templates are partly incompletely punched out. For the unique use and as a gag for a party ok, however, at a wedding I would invest a little more money and access to a high-quality product.
The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + magnetic clasp + beautiful look + stable when it is built up + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors popping through magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber nodules) - some unclean places
- included dowels are much too small and wobble (had no others and did not have a trophy in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (had wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If it did not look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give less stars, because you have to make everything suitable to be really satisfied. Besides, I find it also a little too expensive.
I like the coffee but...
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect I would have awarded 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not go through evenly (if at all!). Also the additional plastic waste (individually packed see photo) means for me a star deduction. I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon collects full score.
Gonna hit me on the clock
The alarm clock came fast and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud to it. I could not turn them down either. Probably a defect, it was supposed to be possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, because I immediately fell out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was tomorrow. However, when the sunrise simulation started it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and also the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also thought that he had a battery so that the clock and the clock time had to be re-entered in case of a power failure.
Light super, processing insufficient
I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a frame - instead, I laugh at a board at this point... There was nothing in the box. "6 pay - 4 get" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have regulated the kulant and fast, but I have determined this only after the return period. Thus, I see this as my fault and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication for the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for two star trigger. The light itself is super. The rooms are now very bright and uniformly illuminated. The light color is rather towards cold white. For hallway, work room, work room, laundry room etc. For living rooms I would personally reach out to warmer light. Completely comparable with a good old 100 watt pear. However, other lamps can also be used and possibly I can get intact copies according to the order. If my evaluation is a help, I am happy about a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I've been thinking for a long time if I order this set, or not. ** The material is stable and it's good in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang it up ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 °F. **They also don't transfer the heat and can be handled directly. **The dishwasher leaves water stains on the black silicone sometimes. But shortly after wipe and they are gone. Finally I have to say that I'm very surprised and I can only recommend
B-goods sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping simply lace. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked. Here we found out that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we have had to notice considerable scratching, abrasions. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless we have the part installed in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw, which can be seen also on the chromed faucet itself scratch tracks / streaks. This part was probably delivered and sent back again. We keep this faucet and build it into the sink in the basement because there it doesn't matter how it looks. Our conclusion; Never again we order such goods via Amazon but rather give something more in the hardware store from where we get ordinary goods. Just find it sad that customers are so screwed up!!!
Product in itself top, external sensor unfortunately already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very simple and the radio range is also very good, but there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use the device which measures the values outside seems to be broken. At the same time, the thermometer seems to be still intact, here still plausible values are displayed. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the external air humidity are always displayed. This is a pity, since the device was installed outside at a protected place and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt of the delivery stand is still busy today with Hermes driving through the Republic without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the service of Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and it results in a nice cut. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. Large flaw is unfortunately the catch basket. On the one hand it is only up and down made of hard plastic and in between fabric. If you put it down completely only briefly, then it will of course be pressed together and parts of the contents fall out. But worse, that the actually practical level indicator shows already half full of the catch basket on red. That would not be so bad if the mower would not lose from there to large parts of the cutting stock. The basket with a large lawn area always empty, when it is only half full, can now not be the solution. Therefore, I have acidified the device as well as possible and sent back. Conclusion: Basically, a very good mower basket, but the unhappy for the construction is used for me.
Good equipment for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. Very good is the supplied pluggable sensor cable, which can be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built up. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to protect the battery only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons I give only 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment can only be closed quite fidgety again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses the connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and insert them again after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without a battery. Always there is an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a little louder.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I still haven't managed to level the hotbed properly until today. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened anyway the hotbed is still too high there and at the front right the screw falls out, because it is not at all attracted even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the car are straight as well as the table too. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because it is impossible to print something out. To the construction: The construction was quite problemless you could only show how to move the cables because you have to relocate the otherwise several times again, which is very hard to do. Support I already wrote on but after a week waiting time still got no answer. Unfortunately, sending back is no longer possible. Had expected something more.
robust and precise I am positively surprised
After many years, my old measuring slider has unfortunately given up the spirit, so a new one had to come. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. There are two batteries, so that it can be started directly. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full score for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old measuring slider. There is also a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument just belongs in every household.
Disgusting, permanent smell
I bought the bracelet and did not wear it for the time being because it emits a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, although it has been constantly "ventilated". After return is no longer possible, I disposed of it. Rate of purchase from
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so that it looks quite massive. The larger balls are free to move, which I find quite nice again. However, the necklace is processed altogether very simply, so that I have torn the clasp two times already. So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that this will not go / hold for long. But for the favorable price you simply can not expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewellery
A beautifully worked bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't open, amazing! I rubbed it in with some leather care, making it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: who has something magnetic on his arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, junk! I was disappointed already after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to function: Connects after a few games.... one does not stick to the instructions at all, only after I had removed a battery from the base station again and put in a new one, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because already after an hour the connection was gone, and that the transmitters were located next to the base station. Also the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all so not to use for me! The thing went back! Would advise from a purchase anyway, brings only trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted. I bought it only for one reason again, I urgently needed it because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line as well as the discharge would fit. I hope that the shaft at the previous pump had a production error and the current pump will perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend to pack the pump in the future a little better than to use a thin-walled carton. I still kept the pump, because as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought that such an organizer is more pleasant than running around with a huge key ring all the time. At the beginning everything went quite well. However, the paint went off quite quickly and the screws had to be tightened. Nice that this also goes with a cent coin, but also only with a cent coin. I did not find a suitable slot screwdriver, which would not have ruined the whole screw immediately. To get to the most annoying thing now: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can put the screws on different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but then you should have screwed the whole thing away first, you need a plier to get the whole thing apart again. The attaching of the keys to yourself is simply a patience, balance and skill game. Finally, at the third time mounting the screw in the thread is broken off and so that the complete thing is unusable. Conclusion: If you can only buy the key for once again, but you can never buy the cheaper alternative again.
Not fully in line with the specified dimensions
Easy-running zippers, the material looks robust and all this in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use. I can say beforehand that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can not really imagine how to pack everything there for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really large parts can be directly in the suitcase - as before too. Note that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, because in the round cosmetic bag were still two smaller bags/bags included. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention this anyway. That the cosmetic bag has a different colour tone and consists of different material than the other bags, does not bother me personally. I regard the price-performance ratio as a sample price and that is ok.
So lala
Now, when I wanted to use it again, he didn't do it anymore. Battery? Switched. But he still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money right into the trash can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should take the brush very carefully to avoid damaging the needle. I could not hear an improvement in the sound of my very high quality record player.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. With there were two black cables. Battery life is very long enough. Definitely perfectly sufficient sound. I liked that the headphones are not painful even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable. The earcups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. Also the weight is kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress, which is well wearable for the most different occasions.. Price-performance agrees here fully, especially since I bought it even in the flash offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I am glad that I did not order it smaller (was recommended). I would have only wished that the neckline would not be so deep, and the sleeves could also tolerate a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
The drive is operated on a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It is assumed that the USB ports will provide enough power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD is usually possible, Blu-rays are detected with maximum unreliability. The discs have to be inserted several times, then Rödel makes sounds like they have not been heard since the 1990s by old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because it will no longer become a thing or the disc is finally recognized. Then, however, you can not push on a break or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or even anything. This immediately leads to an unreliable freeze. In addition, of course, there is no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar charge additional, the price of this drive doubles.
First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually eye-wipe, because only the port that points up is a USB port. The other plug is only there to load any devices and therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it yet, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a sloppy extension, I would certainly not have bought this unshaped lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension fulfills its service very reliably. And because of the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB stick also doesn't just hang around in the area as with a normal extension cord. So no real mispurchase, but my euphoria keeps in tight limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) as well as a display can connect. With IOS 12 you can now push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters which I had to send back could not this unfortunately. Practically is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and that of the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. For what I use my PlayStation :P There was a small adapter with which can be attached to the tablet. This should bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my cover this does not fit with the adapter. Well, it also keeps so safe and has contact from therefore... All in all, however, somewhat expensively justified by the full range of functions. In addition, very small the whole and in one aluminum piece is made stable. Price performance fits.
Plenty of power
Top device. Has been running without problems for months. It's not very light or quiet but it brings good performance. I find the middle position of the temperature (tp setting) rather a bit too cool and therefore I am always on stage 2. Has also fallen several times on the tile floor and survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competitive products look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference is very large compared to the original, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode the location on felt exactly 0.5m. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump once by a few meters which is not annoying. If I would buy it again at any time. However, what would be great would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently he lasts about 1.5h days. Here would be a solution which would create 7-14 days. There is a XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, as long as the battery with us would not have to last and daily change we also find impractical. You should not deal with the dog with his neck band :-). The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem to be comfortable as well. However, the lifespan decreases more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in sports lessons, the sole is broken already after a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used any further. With the last couple it was also in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought for the lessons it will be enough. Unfortunately, it was not so. The shoes are more expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
It fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of crocs has unfortunately broken after 5 years, so I gladly ordered new ones. These are unfortunately at first glance poorly processed. They are comfortable exactly like the ones I had before. At first glance, no difference seems to be noticeable, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly processed and the strap sits at the heel quite loosely and very probably will not last five years like my previous one. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical. However, since I would like to go to a festival this year and sleep in the car, I ordered them for good luck. To the delivery were the mattress and a car air pump included. To the mattress: I designed them test by test in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it does not appear again. In the pumped condition was carried out directly a reclining test. It fits well on it and fits perfectly to the festival. Of course this mattress can not replace the own bed, but the for days at the event it is the pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Previously we took out the seats behind. Thus it fits perfectly. The air pump: the air pump has several adapters again recommending the mattress needs two different adapters, which are already to be found at the pump. The pump is placed on the cigarette lighter of the car. However, the connector does not work well.
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn up by the lappy processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no doors at all and I had to allow more or less my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly because they came to him almost already. The parts often come out confused, which means that you have to build the car apart again to put the parts on. After the car is completely built together, parts fall off when playing. (Mostly the front window. This can also be mounted very badly.) On itself I would not buy this calendar any more and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. The inside flies very well and the 5 min. flight time is usually quite enough. The hair is jammed in it and the drone is broken very quickly I did not expect otherwise at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, no matter whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have questions nice contact.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. I did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an impudence. Since then the computer constantly hangs up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately it fails due to the running time of the battery
I was looking forward to the watch. Design and optics great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. Drr big hook: the battery and its running time. In the evening, only on drm cabinet located overnight and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. If there were many messages during the day, the battery was already at the end at noon / early afternoon and then you can not even read the time. Therefore for, me not usable. Very bad.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+ you should definitely get a case. I like last cases, in which you can also insert the credit card. This offers the case here. If you plug into all 3 compartments cards, it becomes too much, then the lid is a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well processed. It looks noble. The phone is embedded in contrast to many other cases around, only at the connections are cuts. Otherwise you can operate on-off switches and volume controls on the sides well through the case. Subsequent parts is that it is not possible on some QI chargers to load the phone through the thickness of the case. Even on the QI charging station made of leather by TORRO it is not possible. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - you can therefore only charge when the case is off. Otherwise properly chic and well processed!
high quality case with armored glass foil
Robust case mt a proper armored glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers an all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily raised. The material is pleasant in the hand and does not pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some hold. It is not too bulky and is firmly on the phone. Overall a good purchase.
