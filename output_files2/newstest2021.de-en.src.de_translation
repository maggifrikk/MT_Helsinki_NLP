Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his rapid reaction.
Driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on the Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim at around 9.30 p.m. with her VW from Merklingen.
She overlooked the 24-year-old motorad driver coming from the direction of Nellingen.
In the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker tried to evade the passenger car, but still roamed it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the patrol, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
At the moment of his mind, he steered his motorcycle in the green bar next to the road and had it rolled out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker still suffered an injury on the side and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming in Lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security department is monitoring the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive for the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Dingolfing-Landau Landratsamt reported on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we have to take this step to protect the population," explained Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already infected themselves in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that cultivates strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlaid glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep quiet: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
At the farm, infected people were separated from non-infected employees, the grounds are now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avengeable if such local infection occurs and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
This is quite similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthhof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the housing conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
This obviously did not happen."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser

Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station around 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who moved in with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old down.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.

There was no danger from a boarding train.
According to the police, there were conflicts between the two people again.
The 17-year-old fled from the crime scene, but his personalities could be investigated afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended data retention after a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks a half year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a rapid amendment to the law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He felt it would be useful to "make urgent adjustments to the law already now", the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, data retention is suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
But Seehofer wants the amendments before, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it was only reasonable to examine whether legal adjustments were necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already spoken out in favour of data retention in June.
NBA: Strip Club Angers for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), a basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN information, is back in Isloation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these very Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, ed.) have the best Wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that NBA Williams has prescribed a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season final, which starts on Friday night.
Söder comments on the Corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a Testoffensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming, Dingolfing-Landau County, has frightened authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the Corona agent.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt assumes so far that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
"Knowledge Bisse": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He greatly regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "straightened by a bit of conscience and greatly taken away by the extent of the destruction."
In the event of a conviction, according to the prosecutor's office, the man faces ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect now detained had been arrested just a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly got into the eye of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel of the "Bild am Sonntag".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to get around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he had doubts as to whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to attract investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a single European market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this mistake and stabbed the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the acceptance of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've been very occupied with that human."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift I have dealt completely transparently and unscrupulously.
Many people in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a hel from the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": injured and a dead man
The protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again through Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.

Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big snack was missing in the spa town, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organisers: the Rakoczy weekend without a Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale burn, Rakoczy ball or parade, many of them were at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Kurdirektor Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one goes back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have always visited the Rakoczy Festival Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, observes the historical strolling and listens to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that don't belong to Rakoczy.
But you do not have the usual program highlights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic parade and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy tournament to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program partly meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the parade in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was on Saturdays and Sundays in costume on foot in the city.
"It's more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the rider quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of intermission in 2021 a Rakoczy competition will take place again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second division Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football side CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper into the crisis due to a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid had flown to the city of A Coruña in spite of the first Corona Falls on July 20th, one low blow follows the next.
Until Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south west of Madrid still had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the second league threatens.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office investigated for a possible offense against public health, the top sports authority CSD considering the forced descent of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine at a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel and gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos show how players hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after apparently having to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the accusation of deliberately endangering public health.
According to Javier Tebas, son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, the Corona rules established by the football association had not been violated, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Before the departure, there were four infected persons until July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel with them.
Just before the flight on Monday to A Coruña, all players and team members had been re-tested.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members were positive for the Corona test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.

Bike pro Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am laying down the framework conditions with the team just how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had planned to finish his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team were also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
In the past he got up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if".
The professional biker admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult.
"But it did me good to see from the Corona time what I have on cycling and how much fun it is for me."
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August), the time-trial specialist returns to the competition.

Kovac tests Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will perform at the Hessen, the former club of the Croat, on 1 August (18.00 a.m.).
For the Bundesliga it is the first and only hard test before the rematch in the Europa League against FC Basel (August 6).
Because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the meeting is held without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
Sporty, that's an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat in the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eight-time match against Basel in their own stadium with 0-3.

700 dead by monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Because of the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent in boats tries to reach the isolated people.
Whole villages are under water.

Tank rhinos in national park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinoceros died from landslides.
They are protected and considered to be endangered by extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists have brought back to climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most hit by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also maintained in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house were also so small and resembled a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block of flats.
Many apartments are empty, but the government wants them to be taken up by those who have lost their house as a result of the floods.

Argentina rejects counter bid by creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said a statement.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country will again face the state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had asked for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentinean government remains committed to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The latest inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May Argentina had not paid interest receivables of US$503 million and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Professionally arrived - private not yet
"It's going super good" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfeldener Notariatstelle.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the graduate lawyer started working, the normal day-to-day business is already running on full speed.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to move the centre of gravity from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who is a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband could apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she has for the time being also an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Grown up in the neighbouring county, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been a term for her.
When visiting with her family in the past months, she found out again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race for the vacant position in the competition.
Her home of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several stops as a notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at this time she also shouldered "by the way" the doctorate in labour law - she entered in 2012 her first position as notarin in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by a move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because of Lutz Feller's imminent retirement, she saw the right time for her full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of its predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the Notariatstelle in the future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has a praise for the team of the firm ready: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established procedures makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already made contact with a local institution in terms of kindergarten or crib places.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are planning according to the current situation with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators", said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games of the last season caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB had lost about four million euros per game.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal audience seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the account if these revenues break away completely".
In the face of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable sideline".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their salary waiver, which is supposed to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny Miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of around 400 young children, who are cared for every year at the Grazer Kinderklinik.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even one kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be in voice - "and how", Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even though, of course, they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. James Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theatre of the City of Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the teaching.
Although at the end all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional attractions, in the theatre one also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: The TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are certain.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt at a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD sports show.

Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-finals FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-league climber Würzburg reach the final, sixty-six would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final match against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third league.

The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and released her at the side of Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (the heiress).
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Mine".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis, she played in "Weighing Song for a Body".
He married Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953) and his son Benjamin.
In Paris de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage, too, broke up.
Rumours about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach Volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss the final at Comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semifinals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler had recently played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final match on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen took a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: the tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the FDP's point of view, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the party's character.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the radical iceberg in the AfD," said FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The AfD's federal arbitral tribunal had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of trial, the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he said to the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks volumes rather, how many frenetic supporters a far right still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "Flügel" around the Thuringian AfD-Landes- and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the strenght as "secured right-wing extremist endeavour".
In May, the AfD Federal Executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not state an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extreme "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies his membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, Chairman of the Left Party in Brandenburg's Landtag, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf ate only chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the federal party nor the right wing were weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
One wants to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and tries to get under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't let go of the spirits she called.
A throw-out doesn't change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD-Landesverband and the faction held to their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday, he announced that he would take action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the network area of Tennet, have supplied a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North and Baltic Sea is 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, as new wind farms have joined the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we will invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record date this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a little anniversary celebration of the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery the association "Sandtogether" engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really didn't make this decision easy and - knowing how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But in the end, we are responsible here as organisers for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flowed to the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations as well as a follow-up to the current Corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there wouldn't have been much left of a folk festival.
Moreover, the organisational and monitoring burden would rise disproportionately by many times.
Rumberg comforted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came at four starts to four victories on the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz at the start, she was also unable to beat in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle on Sunday.
On Sunday, Werth won against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on the 15-year-old mare Weihegold in the special.
On Saturday, the Germans also lay on Quantaz in front of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had already won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Worms goes further into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" (DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung) provides a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to enable the start of studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities at the university as well as at the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy are used equally.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students already started this year.
So far, the experience of the DFS has been very positive and the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training significantly contributes to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time reinforce our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: "The professorship of the foundation forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management."
For the University of Worms, the trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both motivation and commitment to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future areas of aviation.
In the field of air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, stresses: "With its focus on aviation, the Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, because after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in operation.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford straight ahead at 12.40 at the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the bend and landed at the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of death.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heal wants to test other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions to light again in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative intensification is imminent.
But are they right - and will it remain so?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against general restrictions on works contracts.
After the mass outbreak of Corona at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to adopt a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel when slaughtering, cutting and processing meat.
To this end, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employers' President Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction on contracts of employment and leave to employees if one does not want to completely strangle the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for the customer's added value for large areas of the craft, construction and plant construction industries.
"The errors of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts were useful.
"When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary agency work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It is not possible to explain why in future labour law should apply to portioning and packaging cheeses other than sausages, according to a statement on the proposed law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from works contractors worked in the sector, according to the results of an audit carried out by the NRW Labour Protection Administration, partly 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also established that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law came into force for the meat industry as early as 2017.
However, "tricky constructions" bypassed them.
"Now needs to be fundamentally cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the OSH law, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, measures are also measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example higher testing rates in the field of occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nunnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, all kinds of things, for example, animal transport," said Nunnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more posts were also needed for more controls.
Three dead in the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child had been slightly injured.
Two more people were rescued in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district headquarters.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not initially known.
Clearing of Frankfurter Opernplatz run peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz in the night on Sunday was also peaceful.
Finally, several dozen people stayed in the square, but left it before the curfew began at 1 o'clock.
The police have been in action since the early evening with numerous officials, and a larger police force has been seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on entering the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrators.
At least five officers were injured after police entry, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night for Saturday was also quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 13.25 a.m.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for potential passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car left the road for unexplained reasons and crossed over several times.
In order to save the injured, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car open.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched by the rotary conductor with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
The forces, however, found no one between the high maize plants.
The seriously injured were taken to the hospital in Kassel with the ambulance for further care.
Almost 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigade were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit the 1-0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which did not compete for the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer one of the first games before the end of the season of Serie A.
The second Inter Milan is seven points down.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free kick variant.
An example of Miralem Pjanic's use of the 35-year-old from the penalty limit directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured a brilliant but decisive success.
Only Ronaldo himself with a view of the goal-hunter score should have played the foullfmeter shot at the latte in the 89th minute.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very easily," explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
At the end Juve's calming lead at the top of the table was due mainly to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the match on Sunday, the Sarri team only won five victories.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will still be a goal scorer.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already 34 hits on his account after his three-way pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome in the Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The current Juve pro Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinean scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but has to make up for a 0-1 match break on August 7 against Olympique Lyon in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court judgments, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, police have already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, 155 investigations were conducted at the prosecution offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, one year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as indicated by the Ministry of the Interior's response to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had to compete spontaneously against each other or they had taken the flight from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, because of the many tragic accidents and trials of past years, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before and reported more frequently, said a minister's spokesman.
Especially popular with Rasern is the highway 8. Again and again motorists brake out the traffic there in order to get space and use the free track for a race.
Last August a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racing track"
On the A81, the police even registered more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between narrows and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and emaciated sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers avoid the lawn to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliament.
"The inhibition threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to travel here and there legally with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
From enlightenment or image campaigns Rivoir holds less: "Anyone who ignores all rules in such a way and not only puts his own life, but also the lives of other road users at risk, can hardly be reached with reason".
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-touring force measurement becomes more painful and serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were reported to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured in the races of the past two years.
According to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, sharper penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action is not seen in order to penalise illegal motor races more severely," says the paper of the Interior Ministry.
Bluelight of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Calw County) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man serving drinks on the refrigerator and then leaving the snack bar through a previously beaten-in front door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and bright shoes.
Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
On the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour, cycling pro Pascal Ackermann won his second day's victory.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from the Bora-hansgrohe team won a mass sprint on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victories three and four for Ackermann.
His Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed in the overall classification.
In the morning, the 26-year-old had decided to ski the mountain time and thus took over the top in the classification.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time skiing.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
He simply put on his sprint 300 meters before the finish, "and it worked perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a Corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the complete round trip, drivers and carers in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organisational team and from the media.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control centre gave instructions for lay-reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday noon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived just before 1:00 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions on lay recreation," said a firefighter to BILD.
The arriving rescue forces took the revitalization measures a little later.
The child in danger of life was transported to the university hospital under reanimation.
It's unclear why it happened.
The police routinely started the accident investigation.
The firefighter: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unapproved tuning meeting - police intervenes, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to strengthen control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Mittelfranken police, around 10.30 p.m., the Nuremberg Transport Police found an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they would step up their efforts against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers were among the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police counted.
Of this, however, only a small part of those present are to be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that they were mainly spectators.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-wet protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found that 10 vehicles had undergone such structural changes that the type-approval had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
Illegal car races didn't exist.
"The Central Franconia Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the emergence of spectators," it said.
The agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
That's what special tapes would be used for.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to damage.
"The young people should finally get their cars back unharmed."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected short-time abuse cases
Berlin - According to the Federal Employment Agency (BA), around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowances are investigated.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have indicated short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, CEO of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, responsible for operating business.
When a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the Corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam lasts up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time at our disposal in this hot phase.
So we'll take a closer look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more to do.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves for the case and already train our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money".
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection had been dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday evening some youths would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by precinct drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the Parks of the Foundation, there are always accumulations, where the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19-Vergangverordnung are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without Corona regulations, the parks are closed at nightfall.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist destination
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourist board Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season around a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
The head of the district office, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behaviour of the interns, who had celebrated in several places and might have infected themselves there.
"We all enjoyed doing this in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourist Board launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15th were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party town of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of Corona spread throughout Europe in the early phase of the pandemic.
A total of more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the Premier League on the last day of the season with a 2-0 (0:0) victory over direct rival Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because FC Chelsea was still passing by and qualified as fourth in the league.
In the fight against the descent Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute) in a punitive strike.
After a red card for Leicester City in the replay period, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to the end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eight-finals opponent of FC Bayern, won in parallel with the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) with 2:0 (2:0).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as a Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited from Tottenham Hotspur, which passed the Wolves with a meager 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started in the Europa League as sixth.
Aston Villa decided the distance duel with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth, but had to trembl for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately resembled Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which shot three coaches in the season, descends after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton.
In the end, a point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the best mark with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle tour in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) made the match for Liverpool on Sunday.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the Coronavirus crisis, football in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about early termination or host of the remaining games on neutral ground.
After all, the season could be played without special events - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahus are becoming more and more violent.
In the night violent clashes have occurred.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, the Israeli police forcibly attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld reported.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's headquarters on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in an area demonstration who supported Netanyahu had also been arrested, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because there is a suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a driving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured on his neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Finally, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is given rapid relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has seriously affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate last stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Coronavirus in Israel recently increased to ever new record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - An accident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen claimed nine lightly injured.
A car driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van behind her must have seen it too late.
He crashed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three inmates in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea shuts down border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to combat the corona virus as a "bright success".
Now the country reports for the first time on a suspected case.
Due to a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency had been imposed.
The communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection, according to its own statements, and had described its defences as "enlightening success".
The data were questioned abroad.
Symptoms of the disease were reported to have been identified by a "outlier" who had illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
For the crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was at first no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military admitted the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There were tests on some people.
North Korea reportedly called for an urgent meeting of the workers' political bureau chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspicions.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure "to block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and region from others", it continued.
The person concerned and all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outlier fall" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
Kaesong is estimated to have about 300,000 people.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still under discussion for a long summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the board will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project in the inner city development east", says the middle part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the large hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, however, the appreciation of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently in individual committees even negative, depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) to not let the project, which was developed from the citizenry and then by administration and municipal council, fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "extraparliamentary opposition", "unsuspected", "speculation", "denial" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks it's better to know," says Klein, who has been a member of the local council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim list of citizens.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit would be cheaper for the city; contrary to statements by the city administration, the Technical Town Hall would be cheaper for subsidies, the existence of which Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city would develop in a very different way than one predicts in the town hall and on the part of the proponents of the economy.
To shape the city by its own power and not an investor: this is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller-scale city-centre redesign in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues will also play a key role in particular.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, the VCD says.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the Climate Change Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to take Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test runs were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different than the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman was able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31st, the 33 supercars will race through the Lusatia.
However, Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track a little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally to be fast".
It turns out how fast carpenter really is in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker in the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a crowded calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formel 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will reach into the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister Coldly Caught by Quarantine Decision
The UK Government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister cold.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Because of the rising numbers of Coronas in Spain, the London cabinet cut off the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regime will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to quarantine upon his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rules apply to those who are on leave only on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1st, and were not introduced overnight.
In Austria, by the way, Spain has so far been considered one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"A large number of ministers should have known beforehand that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the severe curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the British's favorite holiday destinations.
The British Government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, excluding the particularly popular Canary Islands and Balearic Islands among British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the Navy in his country that the warships will be equipped with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, which are unique in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to the Interfax Agency, the Ministry of Defense also provided information on successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic rocket built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are regarded as weapons of the future.
Underwatertropedeo continues to be built
It continues to be built on Poseidon's atomicly usable submersible torpedo, it was said.
The planned sea drone is planned for the destruction of coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed on a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns the naval forces celebrated the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside the leader Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video published by the Ministry of Defense not only featured warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help complicated because of Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Centre of the U.S. climate agency NOAA announced at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared an emergency for numerous districts.
The Corona pandemic, which is raging in Texas, makes the work of the helpers more difficult, said Abbott, according to the US media.
Evacuated called for caution
"Every hurricane is an enormous challenge," said Abbott according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
With regard to the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and aggravated, considering that it sweeps through an area that is the most affected area of the state by Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called for caution to people who had to leave their homes.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed", such as wearing masks, said the governor according to CBS.
It is important that everyone kept his distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, Corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit by land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texan coast, according to the authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest-level hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continues to move inland and towards the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on Sunday at wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour in the direction of Hawaii.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected it to continue to weaken.
According to forecasts, it is said to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average Hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could be very strong hurricanes, the authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of them developing into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which is only 10 percent below average, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is closely monitoring the storms and in contact with the affected states.
Four goals denied: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were two goals denied
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals missed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of not given goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team," commented the Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples had gone through a goal of external defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the compensation.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of a sideline position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball again into the net - again the VAR intervened.
Also the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) took back the referee team after hint of the VAR.
During the replay Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology ensures records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for double champion FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defenses after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfield head Joshua Kimmich had the third most minute of engagement, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In the Schmuddelwetter in Munich, the right defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf cart.
How long the unqualified regular player must pause in the fight for the title is open.
The 24-year-old is likely to have a hard time competing in the eight-elfin rematch against Chelsea on August 8th, and can hope for the final tournament, which will start on August 12th in Lisbon.
The Bayern don't want to be stopped by the misadventure of the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wanted to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by his victorious title collectors in the 28 days to the King Class Final on August 23.
"We have simply mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and trophy excellently.
Now it's time to create something special," Flick said.
Until Munich can deal with the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve in concrete terms, however, the eight-elfinal obligation against FC Chelsea is in place for the first time.
After the 3-0 in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the local arena should not again become Bavaria's nightmare like in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and replenish trust with a good game," Flick demanded.
A test for tuning is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had been on holiday for 13 days after the Double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players at Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the course for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has joined in well like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer just train, Flick talked much more about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now trained for the Londoners, who are in play rhythm in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich might face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents in the semi-finals.
One way to the finale in Lisbon "is not quite that easy," stressed the head coach, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know about some of the common tournament preparation, which is particularly important for the 0-on-100 tuning.
With his current team, working was "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winnings" is an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the performers, all were present, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not secured beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to select its world champion
Since it cannot be driven on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All America races were cancelled, however.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more race tracks were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix races during the week.
In October, it is planned to drive at the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal.
On November 1, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 racing calendar comprises 13 races according to the current status.
"We are pleased that we are continuing to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the top class of motorsport are to be completed in this exceptional season.
The Formula 1 season is scheduled to end in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially planned races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, there could still be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations demands races on three continents
The Formula 1 regulations, however, require races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there is to be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the title on the basis of "extraordinary circumstances" due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the imminent Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection meets criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," said Carey.
The rejection of the Americas races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The rejection did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the São Paulo region is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a rejection.
It was prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate Atticist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video switch.
Among other things, she told us about her fight against the world's powerful.
The teenage girl also talked about her famous "bad look" in her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg drew attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes out on the streets" she experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her in social media or even try to silence her find her "funny" because she is shown the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly bad look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at this moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not reckoned with the quick answer and disappeared laughingly from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
Former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance to become the goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three hits in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, among them two turned penalty meters in the replay times of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old now has 34 goals for the season in his account - just as many Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich scored in the last Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: Peter Green, co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73 years, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits to the group for charitable purposes.
He began to perform in wide robes and with large crucifixes.
Mental problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band three years after its foundation in 1970.
A social descent followed.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
Already at a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15 the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was hired as a substitute for his idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green brought the group the first number one hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadows: Green could not cope with the media rumble, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile Fleetwood Mac swam on a wave of success without him in new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green didn't make a big comeback until he started out with a group of friends in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star who returned to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was a blues legend already in his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
