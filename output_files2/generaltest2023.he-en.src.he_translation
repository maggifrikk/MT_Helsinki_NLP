Endangered onion: three cheetah cubs born in Iran
The world's fastest animal falls victim to brutal hunting, droughts and fatal road accidents across the Islamic Republic
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheetah cubs recently emerged into the world in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
It is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic condition of the endangered animal in the country due to droughts, hunters and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of a captive cheetah in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the veterinary team, which is responsible for the Turan National Park in northern Samnan Province, had decided on an imperial birth in captivity.
It has also been noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have recently been recorded in seven different counties in the country.
Due to the danger of their extinction, the United Nations implemented a defence plan for them as early as 2001.
Now, in Iran, it is hoped that the new cubs will be able to bring about an increase in the population of cheetahs in the future.
In January, Iran's deputy minister for environmental affairs, Hassan Akbari, said that the population of cheetahs in the country had decreased dramatically from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12 cheetahs.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that the cheetahs fell victim to drought in their habitats, hunting and even road accidents.
The cheetah is considered to be the fastest animal in the world capable of reaching speeds of about 100 km/h.
The cheetahs can be found in various locations across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify Wants to Upgrade Your Car: We Tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify began to try its luck in the hardware world as well.
After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the US
We put a hand on the first device in Israel
The Vision: Make Your Old Cars Smart
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with old cars.
A few weeks ago, I was given an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the delivery timing was outstanding, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for a few days with an old system replacement.
After two weeks of playing around, I realized how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty about a global launch, I believe many would already prefer to use other solutions.
From idea to reality
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began getting an interesting offer in their email box – an option to purchase a new device with voice control and fourth generation connectivity, which would make any old car system smart.
The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new product to a vehicle simulating a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors returned to the headlines again after the music service updated with the vehicle status – the same one we know today from the app – triggered as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled Car Thing in April, its smart car system.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipping.
So of course, right after the press conference that she held, I went on the website and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited message arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will buy me the option to purchase the device with a little surprise - it will cost me nothing.
After another month of waiting, the messenger finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with Spotify's logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me greatly with the quality of its construction.
And it's a little smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a big, bright, sharp touchscreen in front of it than I expected.
Also, you can find alongside the screen a round and dial button that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer that the company allow changing the dial activity so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, as I can navigate through the touch screen as well.
It may be possible to update a future version.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after exiting the vehicle.
Car Thing definitely brings that feeling back with its construction form.
All adapters connected to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when traveling on dirt roads.
In addition, throughout the whole top you can find small buttons, which can be easily set up to run various playlists or podcasts.
By long clicking on one of the buttons while listening, or by asking the voice assistant, I have set up some playlists that I hear frequently and the radio show that I listen to every morning on the road.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
An old car for a smart car.
After a fairly simple physical setup, I connected the Car Thing to the electricity.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, the connection to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote control, so it can copy all the information on our account from it.
This means that you will still have to connect your smartphone to the vehicle, whether through Bluetooth or through AUX cable in order to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, since like the app on a smartphone, it places emphasis on album images and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one on the app, you can find recommendations for music depending on your taste, the search screen, and your personal library.
As mentioned above, you can navigate between the different screens using the touchscreen or the manual handheld.
Furthermore, you can at any time call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify".
Through it, you can run songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
Manisoni she easily recognized my voice even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.
This is probably due to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
Is it worth waiting for him?
My experience of using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me given that it is still in the initial release stage.
Also used intensively on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Nevertheless, a small stuttering has occasionally been recorded at the interface, but I believe Spotify will handle such bugs with future version updates.
It is evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and of the various versions leaked online during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target.
After all, his activity boils down to controlling the app on a smartphone, and not much more.
What is different from buying a car with a few shekels and connecting it so that the smartphone is closer to us when driving?
This question is reinforced when considering that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify, and will often buy the user much more functionality.
Despite all this, as I used Car Thing more and more, I understood how it could improve the driving experience.
Being able to see the Waze on my smartphone and control the music on a completely different screen is one I have come to appreciate in the last two weeks.
One question remains – will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company isn't telling much right now.
She has not even shared how many test subjects she currently operates around the world, and how much she plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the price that is expected to be $79 (about NIS 255).
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides a first glimpse of the concept Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said that there is currently no information on a plan to launch the device in the country

Have you recruited Talent for the company?
This way you will keep the competitors from "taking" it for you.
The economy is still in a labor market largely dominated by workers, and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talent
Here are some tips to help you keep it in the workplace.
(Laughs)
Despite the increase recorded in the past month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be among the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5 percent (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics).
That is, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely controlled by the workers and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers – the talent.
When it comes to those professionals and managers who are focal points of proven knowledge, experience and competence – the trends in the labor market show that the competition for them, the talent as they are referred to by employers, still exists at full strength.
This means that in the current job market situation they do not have the luxury of resting on the laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a desirable Talent, as once he enters the company's doors another company will try to kidnap him to it.
In other words, the competition for talent is so fierce that even after their recruitment they will continue to receive a plethora of tempting job offers, with 30% of employees leaving just a month from getting the job and starting the job.
That is why intelligent employers will move immediately from the stage of recruiting the talent to its conservation stage, with the path starting first and foremost with preparation and creativity already in the process of absorbing it.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful absorption process will make the talent excited about its new place of work from day one and even look forward to the coming.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper absorption process that will help in the preservation of the new talent:
It's no secret - sharing and readiness of the organization
Share the factors that will work with him on his recruitment, explaining why he is vital and important to society and the role, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who comes to where he is expected and understands his worth will feel welcome and will strive to prove the expectations that a son is hanging.
Knowledge is Power – Coordinating Expectations
As early as the first day, the Talent had a meeting of expectations.
Get to know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can show him the diverse and unique tools you and the workplace can provide to get there.
We are all people – personal acquaintances
During the days of absorption, try to get to know the talent beyond its professional qualities and take an interest in its hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in him and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the limits of his position will appreciate it and would like to keep it.
Curiosity precedes
Already in the absorption stage you can create an attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by discussing bonuses and benefits, but by exposing it to an exciting field or interesting technology, as such stimuli to creativity lead to curiosity and increased interest in the workplace.
The talent was also encouraged to voice his thoughts and opinions to the various projects in the company and made it clear that they were important to the organization.

Electrocution in the pocket: the cost of not closing the coal stations in June - NIS 1 billion
Report of the Knesset Research and Information Center: Failure to close the coal stations at a date set in June 2022 is estimated to be approximately NIS 1 billion
Electric Corporation: "The policy of the use of fuels is first and foremost dictated by the Ministry of Energy"
(Laughs)
The economic cost due to the failure to close the coal stations at the date set in June 2022 is estimated at approximately NIS 1 billion for 2022, a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center reveals.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to rise in the coming months because of the coal price increase.
In addition, by 2023, an additional excess amount of coal use of about 900,000 tons is expected, so this will be reflected in an additional cost to the electricity economy for not closing the coal stations, assuming that the price of natural gas will remain significantly lower relative to the price of coal.
The report said that the reduction of about one billion shekels in the electricity tariff in 2022 meant a reduction of about 4% in the electricity consumption rate for the home consumer.
That is, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about a billion shekels, and the total discount that could have been to the home consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that in the framework of the reform in the electricity economy, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the Electric Corporation, which would establish units operated by natural gas, intended to replace the hydrocarbon units 4-1 on the site of the Rabin lights.
Following this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, stating that the operations of the coal-fired production units should be stopped 4-1 at the Orot Rabin power plant.
The decision set schedules, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly the 4-1 carbon production units will also cease to operate at that time.
The electricity company said in response: "The policy of the use of fuels is first and foremost dictated by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the ministry's decisions, a policy has been implemented in Israel for several years to reduce the use of coal to a minimum possible even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas."
Paying the Price: Everything you need to know for the interest rate increase
Incessant Cuts: Next week the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent
How much will the mortgage charge be?
What is recommended to do?
All answers
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts estimate an increase rate that ranges from 0.25 to 0.5 percent.
If interest rates rise by half a percent, it will already be 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
That is, after years of interest in the economy was close to zero.
The sharp increase in interest rates makes mortgage repayments drastically more expensive and burdens households.
With the help of Shai Zertz, a mortgage specialist, we checked how much more we would pay and what we would recommend doing right now.
If interest rates rise by half a percent – how much will the monthly mortgage payment cost?
In a mortgage amounting to NIS 1.2 million, consisting of 40% prime interest rate track, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage increased since the beginning of the year?
From the beginning of the year, this is a significantly sharper increase.
This is because the interest rates in the rest of the tracks that make up a mortgage (and not just in a prime track) have also increased – in a index-linked track and in the fixed interest track.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, the increase will amount to, according to Shazar's estimate, about NIS 620 in a mortgage of approximately NIS 1.2 million.
The Prime route (40% on this route) will complete a cost increase of approximately NIS 280, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.
The variable interest rate track is closely indexed (26.7% in this track) will complement the increase of approximately NIS 120.
The fixed interest rate track – not indexed (33.3% on this track) will be increased by 220 shekels.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have a mortgage that is mostly indexed, a bundle recommends considering recycling to non-linked routes.
Mortgage creditors whose monthly repayments have been significantly increased and find it difficult to meet repayments - he recommends that they examine to refinance a mortgage and redeploy it for a longer period.
This is to reduce payments despite rising interest rates, as it is always better to meet repayments rather than to be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage takers - he strongly recommends getting to know the different routes and adjusting the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
So too in the future when interest rates go down they will be able to make a mortgage refinancing with minimum early repayment fees.
Regarding the purchasers of apartments from a contractor - a bundle recommends that payments be preceded for the contractor and take a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "construction input index" increases the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The Housing Input Price Index has increased 6.6% in the past year.
Against the background of the increase in this index, on Monday the Banking Supervision Department announced that it was considering creating a mechanism that would allow to include the adherence within the mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
Fuel prices are rising – and Israelis will be forced to pay more than NIS 8 per litre in July.
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95 octane gasoline, will be NIS 8.08
At the same time, it will be extended to the end of 2022, the reduction of half a shekel per litre in tax on the diesel
A decade's record: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 cents per litre - and will stand from July 1 at more than NIS 8 per litre.
The new price per liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 and those wishing to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per litre in the diesel tax will be extended by the end of 2022, the Tax Authority said.
As stated, the price increase is due to the continued increase in oil prices, against the background of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the dollar rate.
Had it not been for the assumption of half a shekel subsidized by the government since April, the price of fuel would have exceeded the all-time high of NIS 8.25 per litre.
The discount expires at the end of July and the Tax Authority and Treasury are currently promoting publication to public comments of an order extending the reduction in tax on gasoline, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
Also, starting August 10, an additional reduction of another half-shekel will be determined, so that only from this date will the price of a liter of gasoline be reduced by one shekel by November 15, 2022.
This was reported by the Tax Authority.
"We've reached a situation where I can't remember five months in a row of state income surpluses.
We started a few months ago with the issue of tax reduction on the diesel.
We've been working on an extension for another four months of the Bello, Gasoline and Solar tax - instead of a half-shekel per shekel.
It's good for the industry and the citizenry.
If we lower, it will affect inflation, reduce production, and ease the cost of living.
As Minister of Finance, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first of all on this," Lieberman said at the Hurwitz Conference on Economics and Society of the Israel Democracy Institute.
As of today, more than half of the price of fuel is the taxes that the government charges (the Blue Tax and VAT) – and this is a high tax rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business expenses, public transport and airfare prices, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the most friendly city for businesses
Open Hope came second in the Ministry of Economy's Business Doing Rankings
Followed by: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon LeZion
Minister Barbbayi: "Corona stressed the importance of local government in the development of business"
(Laughs)
Ashdod is the most friendly city for small and medium businesses.
For the third year in a row, the Small and Medium Business Agency's Doing Business Index found that the Ministry of Economy and Industry ranked local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petach Tikva and in third place streets.
Next are located in order: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beersheba, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency conducts the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The measure is based on several parameters that are examined in each authority, which examine the level of the "friendlyness" of the Authority for Business in its field.
The measure divides the authorities into three groups of magnitude according to the number of residents, since a local authority of up to 50,000 inhabitants is not similar to a local authority of more than 150,000 inhabitants.
T.C. jumped this year.
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: business satisfaction, tender accessibility, information accessibility, and arnona.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to twelfth place and Netanya dropped from fifth place to thirteenth place.
A decline in ranking does not mean that the Authority's business service has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that the service of other business authorities has improved and they have increased in rankings, while the Authority's declining rankings have less improved its services to business.
Among the immigrants in the ranking are Petach Tikva, which rose from 6th to 2nd, and streets that rose from 12th to 3rd.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from 4th to 11th in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to 6th.
"Business - Growth Engine"
The ranking shows that the Galilee landscape leads in local authorities that include between 50,000 and 150,000 residents.
It is followed by Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modiin-Maccabim-Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod HaSharon.
In 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The index is intended to encourage local authorities to facilitate small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the time the business opened and throughout its activities with the authorities," says Minister of Economy and Industry Orna Barbbay.
"Businesses constitute a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of the business product and about 60% of the employees in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct influence on the businesses that are in it.
The corona emphasized the importance of local government and we saw that authorities who acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them became the first government interface for them."
Ran Kuti, director of the Small and Medium Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities have a central and fundamental part in the ability of businesses in their fields to thrive and flourish.
In the past two years, in which we are dealing with the Corona crisis, authorities have greater weight in helping businesses survive in their fields and survive at all."
2021 by mail: 20 parcels per household - and a leap in weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 – similar to 2020
Average weight per pack stands at 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight stood at 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail parcels arrived in Israel, on average almost 20 packages per household, according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Today.
The number of packages reached in 2021 is similar to 2020, which reached 46.5 million packages in Israel, and lower than 2019 – which reached 61.6 million packages.
This year, however, there has been a jump of more than 36% in the weight of packages coming from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a 36% increase from 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in Consumption Habits
The average weight per pack jumped 60 percent in two years – from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The jump in package weight is mainly influenced by two major trends, both from the seller and from the buyer: the major overseas shopping sites combine items for one shipment and no longer ship each product from the "shopping basket" in a separate package.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the rapid delivery of the shipments, within a few days of the order, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which the purchasers are interested in receiving close to making the purchase.
Also in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month when the most packages came from abroad at the highest weight and the highest number of items is December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per pack was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
The Black Friday Effect
More packages arrived in December than any other month, possibly following the November shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The large orders begin to arrive in Israel between one and two weeks after the purchase.
Study: Most employees in the economy are unaware that tax returns can be obtained
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels
Have you changed jobs?
Did you go out to the U.S.A.?
Have you moved from town to town?
You may be entitled to receive a substantial sum in a simple procedure
All the details – inside.
Most renters are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax returns, which can accrue to high amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report from about two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion, which means that you should also check whether you are eligible to receive tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a high amount, as four out of five employees are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, tens of thousands of employees are served each year.
If you think these funds are going to go to waste anyway, think again: Hirers can apply for income tax refunds for six years back.
Tax:On conducted an in-depth study of 4,000 of its customers regarding tax returns during 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion in terms of population groups and gender, age and geography.
The data show that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis and the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of workers per ILO, there were a number of significant changes, centered on an increase of 15% in the average amount of return to a household that stood at NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that the start-up fees are lower than the salaries and therefore there is a gap between what the employee paid as a tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest return received in 2020 by a customer of the company was NIS 121,054 for returns over the past 6 years.
What can I get tax returns for?
One of the reasons for receiving tax returns is a change in the workplace.
For the 81% of people who changed jobs during the year, an average tax return of NIS 2,943 was generated.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The figures show that 74% of women who gave birth and spent more than 16 weeks on maternity leave were eligible for an average return of NIS 3,538 for the same year.
Another reason for the return is donations.
100% of the people who donate and pay taxes have been refunded.
Another reason for the refund is non-registration credits for alimony. 63%
From the divorced we have not updated a credit point for alimony and therefore the tax refund for any year that has not been updated such a credit point is NIS 2,616.
Due to unemployment - Expenditure to the IHL: 93% of those who were sick or unemployed and who earned over 12,000 shekels received a tax return of NIS 4021 for the same year.
Other reasons for tax refunds are: reimbursement for life insurance payments, life insurance on a mortgage, return on a winning return, return on securities losses, non-registration of credit points for a man for birth and distribution of tax refunds by geographic location.
- 94% of people who deposited personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In an examination conducted for every one million shekels from a 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax return for the period is over 20,000 shekels for the entire period of the mortgage.
100% of those who move to a winning settlement received a tax refund for the transition year since approval of residency in a winning settlement is granted only after 12 months from the date the resident becomes a qualifying resident and thus in fact the first year is paid full tax.
79% of customers holding securities were entitled to a refund of the said years tax.
However, those who hold securities are important to check each year since losses are not rolled out from year to year but only through filing a report.
56% of men who have a child do not register credit points in the year of birth in the pay slip.
The rate of return can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tax:on CEO, Tal Carmon: "The Corona crisis has caused the Israeli hiring public to become much more active.
He is interested, checks and demands what he deserves in income tax returns.
It turns out that sitting at home, in the IDF or after being fired, of hundreds of thousands of Israelis over long months, has caused many salaried workers to examine in depth what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today all procedures for receiving tax returns can be carried out digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that has deterred many in the past."
Employment Market: Fewer Job Candidates, More Salary
OLJOBS report to conclude 2021: top demand - jobs with no experience
The scope of jobs offered increased by 50%
"Looking for work, but not storming the market"
In the year just ended, there was a 15% drop in the number of resumes sent, and on average only 23 candidates ran for each position, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year, according to a report by the Oljubs website for 2021, on the coronavirus crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were primarily interested in jobs-saturated areas such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, the inexperienced jobs led to the top of the demand with more than 38,000 searches – probably following the return of young people with no professional experience in the search for immediate work, at the end of the VAT payments.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and retention had little less than 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the coronavirus crisis, wages in 2021 rose by 2% compared to 2020, and the average wage in Israel was NIS 11,675 gross.
The monthly salary in the field of software was NIS 17,915 on average, and in information systems analysis it was NIS 17,140.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a wage gap of more than 2,000 shekels: in the center of the country it was 12,500 shekels on average, compared with 10,795 in the north and 10,135 shekels in the south.
Gender-wise, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the extent of the hours, was maintained and stood at 36%.
Men earned NIS 13,295, compared to women's wages of NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back on track.
On the side of business, cross-growth was recorded in almost all branches of the economy, and businesses longed for working hands.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40,000 jobs at AllJobs.
A survey conducted by the website among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of them indicated their intention to increase the total fundraising but 72% understood that this year would be difficult.
The largest supply was for inexperienced jobsand those were more than 58,000 at the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration roles with about 44,000 jobs in each field, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and stockers still in demand at 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boymfeld, Director of Research and Content at Oljavos: "The job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
Also, the prolonged disconnection from the work cycle makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living."

"Unobvious": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrating the fact that "we can live the way we want", excited about the audience meeting and making sure to spend time with the children
Weekend and Kobi Shimoni's Independence Day, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
"Weekends are the most important moments in life for me.
The sanctification and tradition are very deep roots in my soul.
My Fridays are dedicated to children, Or (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and groceries for consecration, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play cars on a sign.
Sometimes you go to the beach, or even just wash the car, but always stop on the way to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store – and there is always another excuse.
When we come home with the gifts, the smells of cooking greet us."
What does your Friday meal look like?
"I was blessed with breweries around me.
On my side is a Persian-Tunisai kitchen, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing and joy.
On the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with lots of meat.
When we get to my mother-in-law, already from the lobby of the building, amazing smells arise from her apartment.
I usually do the sanctification, along with the children, who know him by heart.
In the end, my after-dinner fun is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump at me like I'm some kind of inflatable."
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Saturday to Israeli music on the third network and to the pale tracker skits, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every corner of the country made him proud.
He died three months ago of a serious illness, and for him consecration and Sabbath was the Holy of Holies, mainly in the sense that the whole family should be together.
I recently released a song in his memory called 'Guardian of You', which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he was proud of this piece, which sanctifies the bond between father and son."
Soon we will mark the 74th Independence Day. As a zealous Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
Independence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who gets to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would have climbed trees and tied to a string house with Israeli flags.
Today my days of independence are full of performances, and you always meet an insanely happy audience, which celebrates that we can live the way we want.
We need to keep that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren have that option as well, and remember that nothing here is self-evident."
Friday: Esty Zakheim welcomes the Sabbath
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": a Friday meal that Esty Zakheim dreams of, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband keeps Shabbat?
Tell us about your preparations to sit down.
(Laughs)
"Preparations start as early as Thursday night, when I come back from a play or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking like a skier, roast and sauces.
On Friday, in the first part of the day, I devote time to myself, meeting with friends and friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I participate in rehearsals.
In the summer the Sabbaths come in late, and I have plenty of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good series.
At the Shabbat meal I usually host my mother, Varda, who celebrated 89th, and also friends."
Can you share more cooking?
"I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry it.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
Most of the cooking I make, and they of course heat up on the plate on Saturday.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in the winter - the cholent."
Your husband is a religious man and you are from a secular household.
How does it work?
"Living with a Sabbath keeper is an endless compromise.
"And you shall love your neighbor as yourself," in fact.
For family trips he couldn't go out, so I often found myself packing up the kids and joining friends' family trips.
In addition, I am also the children's on-call leader, the one who brings them back Friday night from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat, because I usually don't perform on the Sabbath and get a kind of 'forced vacation' - and that's a good thing."
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
"I would open a big table and invite'my dead'.
Sometimes I imagine what it would have been like if my brother Daniel had been alive, or if my father, Schneor, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16:30).
We must have been fighting about football and politics and celebrating each other."
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
We were a warm and united family.
On Friday afternoon, Mom would make a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pitas from the market and burn eggplants for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hannah's by the hand of Elijah, or as she would say 'the hand of Elijah', and she would make blintzes.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she used to make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the brothers, and looked after me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father in Jaffa Port, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing."

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck Engaged
Almost two decades after their love story ends in a breakup, Lopez and Affleck return to each other's arms
Lopez splits from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
(Laughs)
One of his: Almost two decades after their first love story that ended in a breakup and a year after the well-publicized comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck close a romantic and engaged circle.
The happy news shared last night (Friday) Lopez with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com
(Laughs)
The news of the engagement comes after this week's recorded Lopez is walking around with a giant diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez were indeed engaged.
Remember, the last time a falconer (49) pulled out a ring and offered Lopez (52) to be his forever it was in 2002, and then it was an eye-catching ring with a six-carat giant pink diamond, valued at an estimated $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two broke up in 2004, accusing the media of being overly obsessive and constantly probing their lives.
Since then, Affleck has been able to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez has been married three times before, including to singer Mark Anthony, who together turned parents into twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she broke up in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians talk: "You can't make up what's happening to us"
"The Chaos Never Ends", insists Mother Kris Jenner on the new series starring the first family of the reality show, and receives backing from her daughters and the new producer
In an article published in Shabbos magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR grinder, the brand factory and the change that Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm not the same one who thinks for hours about which bikini selfies to raise"
This may come as a surprise to many, but the most sought after brand in 2022 of the Disney content empire, which among other things also includes Marvel Pictures and Star Wars, is the Kardashians.
The contract details of the first family of reality and social media with Disney have not been disclosed, but estimates suggest a minimum of $100 million has been transferred to the family's daughters, who are now also functioning as producers.
In a journalistic encounter with the stars, each accompanied by an entire biotic team that takes care of makeup touch-ups, hair and wrinkles in their clothes non-stop, the family members insisted, as did their new and sought-after producer, who this time is not a reality show, this time what is being received on the screen is completely authentic.
"You can't make up what's happening to us," the mother of the family, Kris Jenner, says emphatically, "the chaos is endless."
"We're showing how much we've grown since that series that came up in 2007," says Chloe Kardashian.
"When we started out we were terrified, a lot happens to us in life and you can't just assign everything to a narrative of beginning, middle, and end.
Many plots were expedited in editing, wrapped in a sugary coloured film and forgotten on the side.
This is not what real life looks like.
Now we are more exposed, facing the camera naturally, not just reality TV but an authentic documentary series."
When confronted with their new involvement in producing the series, which in fact gives them complete control over the content being received on-screen, Chloe argues: "We're involved behind the scenes, seeing clips while editing and making comments, but not from a defensive place but simply giving our opinion on what will make the series better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel I've gone through an emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more of a set of boundaries."
"I've grown up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from cheap Trush-Reality to an attorney with an agenda.
"I've grown up," she argues, "I raise four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
That's my motivation."
"I'm no longer the same Kim who thinks for hours about which bikini selfies should be raised," she insists, "but it's also not completely gone from my life.
A man must be true to who he really is and take it all in fun."
For the reasons for firing the producer discovered by Ryan Seacrest and for their very new and profitable way in the industry, the significance of the move to Disney, the family's oiled PR machine and its impact on brand profitability and more, in the full article to be published in Shabbos magazine.

The international festival in the capital, which has become a tradition and will take place in a number of locations will present musical performances by leading local artists, and will combine circus performances and innovative and surprising artistic performances
(Laughs)
Like every summer over the years, alongside the warmth, humidity and boredom of the students, there is also the international outdoor festival Jerusalem Creator, which has already become a tradition in the capital and will take place in several locations (including the Mitchell Garden, the Sultan's Pool, opposite the Tower of David and the foothills of the Old City) - from 15 to 27 August.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on the relationship with his father
Winner of "The Next Star" finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and his father's significant presence in his life
"The song tells about the way to keep in touch from afar," he says.
Tamir Greenberg on a second single titled "Into the Night" after conquering the audience with his first single and participating in "The Next Star".
In recent months, Greenberg has continued many performances: Tel Aviv Cultural Hall, Tel Aviv Opera House, Amphi Shuni, Amfi Ganei Yehoshua, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
The song Into the Night was produced and processed by Greenberg along with producer Autumn Bagger.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to memories of his childhood and his father's significant presence in his life.
"The song talks about the relationship between my father and me.
About the time I left the country for the U.S. and the way to keep in touch remotely," says Greenberg.
In the coming month, Greenberg will appear at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and for the new season of "Next Star", the song he won on the show, "Tell Me Where the Light Goes", has been selected as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Blue and White: Yuval Shamla is the biggest winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world
The phenomen climbed Mount Madurayama in 26 seconds and picked up the title of "First Israeli Ninja"
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of Ninja.
The
There is a winner: Yuval Shamla has conquered the Midoriyama, and he is the winner of the fourth season of Ninja Israel and now holds the title of the first and 16th Israeli Ninja in the world.
Shmala has been a participant in the show since its first season then finished in first place, and in the second season lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season he again won and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the last season.
This evening he first climbed Mount Maidurayama in 26 seconds and finished in 1st place, after beating the challengers to be backed by Queen Vichy Chalfon.
Queen managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season only one ninja can be crowned who has managed to climb the midurayama in time.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, as a season-winning jubilee climbed the Midoriyama by 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the world title of Ninja.
He'll be able to re-compete for it next season.
Well, we get it, that full of superheroes, harnessing perfect rock, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sporting event in the world
(Laughs)
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sportscaster sat in the finals of a reality show and acted as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
(Laughs)
Rotem Sela represents for us such a perfect feminine ideal, that it is distorted to present it like this on television.
She earns more on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss on the spot, and when necessary - also to advocate for her business partner.
She is a mother and also a career woman who publishes banks and air conditioners, models and leads reality shows, and serves for young girls as an unattainable role model.
And maybe it makes sense that a rock harness goes through too perfect a screen, because in the show it hosts, you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the world of the ninja everyone is larger than life, and the facilitators first.
Assi Azar had become embroiled in an affair that was supposed to erase him from the screen for a period of time, but since he is not an ordinary human being, he was rescued from it even before the first batch of commercials.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who has broadcast European Cup and World record winnings in his lifetime, but is excited about Megawall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, he sat alongside him as the commentators of two Olympic medalists (Jordan Jarbi and Linoy Ashram), as if to highlight how rare and high-quality the conditions of entry into the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons.
"Ninja Israel" went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Maidurayama and Yuval Shamla who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
There, he led an almost impassable course, one by one bringing down all the superhuman characters that the show had arranged to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Want to be a Ninja Turtle?
Not with us.
This is where superheroes are sought out.
The emphasis was on searching for an heir to Sheloma, who is referred to as the "King of Kings and One of a Kind", and other nicknames designed to clarify how perfect and disposable he is.
As a result, the difficulty level was raised, the girls trying to cope with the season's tracks crashed, and the boys raced among themselves to see who had more squares in their stomachs and a charisma of plywood to get into the shoes of Shamla the quitter.
They will say that it is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents a overcoming of difficulties and challenges, but in terms of the vast majority of viewers – medium armchair yams like us – "Ninja Israel" nurtures for us an unreachable sports-achievement model.
Faster, stronger, taller, more perfect.
When Gil Sassover moves between Punches and conversations about sainthood
It's strange to see the comedian, X "Comedy Store", host of the Saturday reception program on Channel 14, where he tastes removers and gives a stage mainly to men.
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question "What does the concept of 'preparation for Shabbat' remind you of?".
Say: Sponja and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Jeroen Ilan or Avi as a TV pain, but the strangest would be if someone suddenly said "Gil Sussover".
Because Gil Sassover in the middle of the sponja and cooking is the most unrelated that television can offer.
And really, "Receiving Shabbat", the new show he hosts on Channel 14 on Friday afternoon, is cut off in spirit from the time it is broadcast.
Over half of it - Sussover stands.
He speaks quickly, holds a microphone in his hand even when tasting rations, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about sainthood.
In his defense it will be said that the budget poverty is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also felt in the premiere show, which was broadcast two days ago from Binyamin headquarters, is a clear gender division.
The men sing, play, dance, speak Torah, market restaurants and factories – while the women settled for a small item, in which they told excitedly about running a dressmaker.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Saturday reception with Gil Sassover, now 14
"Protected Housing Association v. Ruthie Russo: Saying 'It tastes like protected housing' harms our operations"
Chairwoman Yuli Gat sent a letter, in which she expressed the union's complaint against an insulting statement, according to them, of a "next restaurant" judge in one of the trailers for the show
Ruthie Russo responded, "It's a joy that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Protected Housing in Israel against the "next restaurant": In a letter sent by chairwoman Yuli Gat and arrived at "Israel Today" it reads: "In the pre-broadcast trailer, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said 'food tastes like sheltered housing', i.e., closed institution food with low-level food."
"The tone chosen by the program's judge, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant submitted immediately cancels our many years of activity to fight against the pits that exist in the field, because the sheltered housing houses run restaurants in the various homes in favor of the tenants with the highest level of chef dishes."
It added: "The service staff and house managers are struggling for the image of protected housing offering solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including eradication of loneliness, abundant leisure activities, high standard of living and more."
In Israel in recent years, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most difficult disease in old age and view community places as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, so we devote resources and efforts to serving the residents the finest food.
Most sheltered housing houses use professional chefs to build a menu.
We will be happy at all times to invite the judging staff to be impressed by the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel as well as on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff in the sheltered housing houses we will ask for your apology and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly."
Ruthie Russo said in response: "It's a joy that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population, which certainly deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, chefs and chefs everywhere, even in assisted living."
"Double morals: in Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't cancel?"
Nick Cave Responds to Criticism
The singer referred to the criticism that was hurled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"
Nick Cave cancelled a concert in Russia earlier this week due to the war and declared that he "stands by Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon".
In this, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also cancelled performances in the invading country.
But in Kiev's case his cancellation notice took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet plastered the singer he painted, as in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two performances that took place in Israel, despite the criticism he received on behalf of pro-Palestinian organizations.
At the time of his visit to Israel, Kiev told local media: "In the end, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
This same Ahmet well remembered Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The admirer even posted on the singer's personal, uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a poignant post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying country, and therefore the situation of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your message about Ukraine," Ahmet wrote. "is that you did not support the Palestinians that way, who are also suffering from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion Israel is first and foremost the cause responsible for Palestinian suffering.
It makes me very sad, for you represent a double standard here," concluded the Turkish admirer.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he stressed that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is a one-state unprovoked attack on its neighbor, hoping to change the security order of the whole of Europe.
The second situation is a complex friction between two peoples.
While the conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel a great deal of sympathy for all these communities – no matter where they are and who they are."
Kiev added that although he was not interested in detailing his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians as well, noting that in the past 20 years he has been attending fundraisers for them.
"But this is no time for debate, Ahmet, this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently taking place on their soil in a catastrophe.
I have great admirers in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would."
In light of the decline in morbidity: Corona Projector will return to manage Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the Corona treatment policy in the third and fourth wave
At the request of the Minister of Health Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue concurrently in his role as a Practor
Prof. Zarka: "Happy that the Omicron wave continues to fade, and yet it is our duty to prepare for another wave"
(Laughs)
Against the background of the decline in coronavirus morbidity, the Corona Projector, Prof. Salman Zarka, will return to manage Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue concurrently in his role as Viktor.
"I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to fade and that we have received our normal lifestyle back," said Prof. Zarka, adding, "It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a result of the virus still being here, in Israel and around the world."
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the Corona treatment policy in the third and fourth waves.
From May 1, Israel has returned to a "between waves" state, which includes reducing most of the corona's arrays, while maintaining capabilities to carry out continuous checks and investigations, which will form the basis for action in the event a new variant is discovered.
Concealed morbidity
The Corona Campaign National Knowledge and Information Center report, published this morning, stated that "there is a decline in the average of new confirmed to below two thousand per day, on a weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized and hospitalized in a difficult situation".
However, they stressed that "there is an underlying morbidity of significant extent and in practice the number of infected is much higher.
The number of institutional tests carried out in the community (without weighing the tests returned from abroad, M.I.) - is low, and stands at less than 20,000 tests on a weekly average only.
The low scope of testing makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends."
State Comptroller's Report: The actual budget for most years of operation of the pharmaceutical basket committee – less than the recommended budget
According to the report by Matanyahu Engelman, for more than 20 years of basket activity – the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activities of the committee
The report further states that the minutes of the meetings are published significantly late, if at all
Also, the auditor recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activities – and updating the basket work procedures
Another flaw that has been found concerns that since the committee began operations, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the scope of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket – which would have allowed the analysis and review of the budget given to them.
The Pharmaceutical Basket Commission is one of the most influential public committees in our daily lives and health.
Each year, the Committee decides on new medicines to be given to the public free of charge through the HMOs – but a new State Comptroller's report released Tuesday warns that this has been in operation for more than 20 years without any control reports being made on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council overseeing and reviewing its activities.
"Israel Hayom" reporter Ran Reznik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing revelations in "Israel Hayom" about the failures of the medicine basket.
According to the report by Matanyahu Engelman, he recommends "to carry out in the process of expanding the basket corrections and improvements, which will result in a more qualitative utilization of the health care basket budget that the public is entitled to".
Throughout the years of the existence of the supplement mechanism for the pharmaceutical basket, in the years 2021-1998, the state budget was supplemented with eight billion shekels of medicine – with the supplement moving annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the health care basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated for the basket's expansion was less than the scope of the requests.
In most of the committee's operating years (90% of the time), the budgetary supplement amount was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.
The reviewer notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the height of the annual addition with the aim of allowing certainty and long-term planning.
Engelmann further noted that "the transparency model in basket work is lacking".
Thus, for example, the procedure of the work of the basket committee states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the protocols are published in a delay of 160-109 days, when sometimes the final minutes of the meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in publishing the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of the bidders – patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies – may be impaired to make repeated requests as soon as possible and relevant, after they have learned lessons from rejecting their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and revised their proposals and re-evaluated the feasibility of accepting them in the next round," the reviewer noted.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set in the procedure".
Out of thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was made.
Another review by Engelmann concerns a preliminary procedure of evaluating the technologies submitted to the pharmaceutical basket.
The comptroller found that about half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the postponement.
Another flaw concerns the activity of the subcommittee of the medicine basket that is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and costs of drugs are discussed.
The auditor recommends adding a public representative or examining the possibility of publicizing the discussions without confidential commercial details.
In the procedure under which the Health Services Basket Committee operates, it was determined that "economic assessment should be submitted" to a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one out of thousands of submissions have been submitted – and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, for the 2021-2019 Basket Committee hearings, applications were submitted to add to the Anti-Objection Medicines basket.
The report found that the requests did not include economic assessments, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing diseases caused by obesity or the ability to avoid gastric shortening surgeries.
It is further found that the decisions of the pharmaceutical basket committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019 the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparation for the treatment of the growth of chronic diseases as targets, but within the framework of decisions regarding the expansion of the basket no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The comptroller also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the health funds are also included in the medicine basket, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health ("Third Supplement").
This is when the legal framework for this step is only regulated in retrospect.
In the last six years, NIS 74 million has been used from the addition to the medicine basket for these services.
Engelmann recommends that the Ministry of Health update the procedures of the basket work and also determine whether there is a need for a separate supplement for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as "no extra cost drugs", the use of which does not cost the health funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The reviewer proposes to examine the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and abbreviated route, so that the medicine basket can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no control over the use of expensive drugs.
The criticism also shows that since the work of the basket committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked health funds to report nor has it supervised the scope of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports have been published relating to the years 2009-2006, and these have also been published with considerable delay (the latter was published this year and dealt with budget utilization from 2009-2007).
"The delay in conducting inspections may make it difficult to collect and analyze the data, irrelevant to the conclusions that arise from the examination after such a long period of time, to the improper pricing of the subcommittee and to make decisions based on non-final findings," the report said.
The ministry also does not review and supervise the uses of expensive drugs and has not carried out lessons.
This is 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2021-2016).
For this, the comptroller wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health perform individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use compared to estimates.
Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the subcommittee, and how to prepare estimates when pricing medicines and technologies and improving them."
"Shocking and Inconceivable": A heated discussion at the Health Committee about the poisoning at Beit Daphna
The indexes of the first deceased lettuce were normal ten minutes before her death
Chairman of the committee, MK Silman: "If the people there cared that the kitchen would be like home - it wouldn't look like this."
Ten minutes before the first lettuce about 40 years old from Beit Daphna in Holon died of food poisoning, she was taken with medical measures that were normal, the health committee said Tuesday.
"We have night care providers checking during the night and there's a nurse doing rounds.
There were a number of reports of diarrhea cases and the same tenant actually last time she was taken measures were 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was monitored like the rest of the dikes with diarrhoea.
She's a nursing patient, we went to get a menoch to assist in her transfer and then the same tenant didn't respond.
We started CPR and called the nurse of the clinic," the daycare director described what happened last Sunday morning at the daycare center.
This is an event in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and a total of about a quarter of the residents (33 out of 131) had diarrhea to host contaminated surf meat.
The caretaker said this against the background of claims that death from food poisoning is indicative of neglect and lack of follow-up by the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Noss, Director of Epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, noted that "we cannot conclusively determine what the three hydrates died of.
Only blood tests were taken from them."
It was further suggested that even the residents admitted to the hospital could no longer have a stool sample because they did not have diarrhea and therefore the cause of death and morbidity could not be determined with certainty.
An engineer on behalf of the Ministry of Health further noted that "the Ministry of Health examines a state of being in the kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or a request for a license renewal".
The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that the investigation committee had not yet been appointed to this case and to a previous case of abuses in the shelters that occurred three months ago at the Bnei Zion Institute in Sharon.
The chairman of the Health Committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the discussion: "If the people there cared that the kitchen would be like home - it wouldn't look like this.
The tenants in the welfare dormitory need more.
They are sensitive to health and need care and care.
It's shocking and unimaginable what happened there.
The terrible findings that were discovered are even after they knew that the Ministry of Health had come to check.
Where is the supervision and responsibility of the offices?
How is it that there are no ministers and office CEOs present to explain what is going on here?"
Yigal Natumi, CEO of Beit Eckstein who runs the daycare center and even ran the daycare center himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire organization are rising up with only one goal: to do good for people.
The people who died are people I took care of personally.
One of the tenants fell asleep on the hands.
It's an exciting event for us."
Smadar Una, a former resident of an identical residence her age, lashed out at him, saying, "Enough with the lies and the beautiful words.
I was there."
Gali Barmi, a representative of parents Bakim Israel: "We have complained in the past about the food and have not received the criticism."
Oren Hellman, founder of the Equal Chance Initiative for integrating people with disabilities, protested that the names of the deceased sponsors were not published: "Their names are not known at all.
Are they worth less?
We underestimate the lives of our children."
Suspicion of Wolfson omission: the surgeon caused a heart rupture - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Pras Abu Akar as the director of the hospital's thoracic surgery unit
The Chairman of the Committee of Physicians complained that the Headmistress, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment
Hospital: "He's appreciated and experienced"
First publication: A horrific mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor performed a tear in the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was conducted on April 19.
This was the first operation performed by Dr. Pras Abu Aker at the hospital, after being appointed to the Director of the Chest Surgery Unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
However, the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions when it came to hospital management.
The Director of the Oncology Institute and Chairman of the Committee of Physicians, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation into the affair in a letter to the hospital director, Dr. Anat Engel.
In the letter, he made very serious claims about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar after the previous unit's director, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
A huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient has been lucid, functional and treated by him for the past four years.
He recently had an infestation of the disease, and an abnormal build-up of fluid within the pericardium, within which the heart muscle was found.
Also, surgeon Dr. Abu Akar was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, the operation had a serious malfunction, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of the heart and chest surgery department at Wolfson, who was at the time in the operation of a child in the next room, "was urgently called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
According to him, the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar was not professionally and personally suited to manage a chest surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and although he was supposed to be the direct director of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
He added: "This is an uncomplicated procedure, which lasts a few minutes," and added: "It is impossible not to refer to the flawed process of accepting Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
The question arises whether there is a direct responsibility of Engel for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient."
Experienced surgeon
Information and claims were raised to Israel Today by other senior doctors who reinforce the questions raised in the case of Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, chief surgical officer at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint, writing that Dr. Abu Akar is "one of the more experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young breast surgeon".
He also added that he was elected in a proper tender and Dr. Dekel took no part in it, in accordance with his declarations of his desire to "disengage" from the chest unit.
He added: "I wasn't part of the process either, and I may have been meant to be.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Pras Abu Akar began working on 10 April and was entitled to 100 days of grace, "All hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it unfortunately ended.
Wolfson Hospital said in response: "We share the family's grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The chest surgeon mentioned in the article is an esteemed surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in a tender to manage a chest surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Haggai Dekel, his quoted remarks are inaccurate and have been taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very difficult situation.
The hospital is looking into the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case."

A model for healing: three senior doctors tell about their mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially during the plague
Dr. Shlomi Kadosh does not forget, even from the height of his position, the push from the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik
And Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanks Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld for the lesson in identifying with the patients
Three key people in hospitals write about who inspired and encouraged them to be better, as therapists and as human beings.
Three senior doctors, three life and professional teachers: on the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, "Israel Hayom" invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kadesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to recall the characters who accompanied them at the beginning of the road – and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba
About Prof. Marvin Shapira z"l
The meeting that opened my eyes - and changed my life
Had I not met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the infectious disease unit at Hadassah Hospital, I would probably have remained an expert physician in internal medicine.
He was the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to engage in it.
I met him in the halls of Hadassah, E. Back in the 1980s.
For a moment I didn't think I'd leave the interior, as I liked the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases was also expressed in neurology, also in the interior, and in virtually every area.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
All along, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that goes down to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor in all his soul, who loved the sick and taught me not to take things for granted and to look deeply into everything.
He was a real and honest man, devoid of ego, qualities I loved very much.
At first, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and who influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Joseph Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go to medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Chapera.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this dayfor example, "Tishu Iz de Ishio", i.e., taking a tissue biopsy from the affected organ allows one to know which drugs are worth giving; or "Won Yo Hewes Itt, Yu Luz Itt", designed to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to the bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in Hadassah and fathered two daughters.
He died about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven I cried.
He was somethinga witty, wise epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat the plagues, and he was greatly missed during this time.
If he were with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the pest control team.

Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, Director of Soroka Hospital
About Prof. Shaul Soknik z"l
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
(Laughs)
I first met the late Prof. Shaul Soknik when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I came to a round of internal medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine that he ran.
Later I also returned to the department in rotation in the sixth year, and I did the final work of the medical school under his direction, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis (multiple joint inflammation).
Shaul has influenced every significant node in my professional life for 20 years, and has been the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; not only professionally, but also – and most importantly – personally and humanely.
During the internship, I debated between family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about choosing the internship.
Eventually I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.
During the internship he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways – in scientific writing (sorry Saul, I didn't persevere enough), in contact with patients, in working in a multi-professional team – an area in which the department excelled – and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I recognize in me, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from Saul.
When I finished my internship and debated whether to travel for a period of study abroad, Saul pushed and directed me, assisting me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to behave.
The training period was a very important time for my professional development, and without Saul's support and push I'm not sure this would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital management, again Saul was the one who supported and assisted.
We later worked together through complex periods in the Internal Medicine Division.
Saul knew how to wonderfully integrate the teacher, the manager, the friend, and the teammate, without his various roles interfering with each other.
I strive to succeed like him in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are now throughout the medical system in Israel, and commemorate their excellent work and memory.
I'm honored to be appointed with this group.
Brought to light: Ilya Yegorov
Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of Schneider Children's Medical Center
About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld, founder and former director of the ICU at Schneider Children's Medical Center, taught me to be an ICU doctor, but more than that – he taught me to think.
The obvious thing I've learned from him is to take care of the most complex, the sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious is to have very difficult, perhaps the most difficult, conversations with families who never imagined they would get into these complex situations in an intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it's the obvious.
But I learned things from him that are even deeper and more profound.
In hindsight, since I am a doctor she manages and manages who is a doctor, it is clear to me today the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Schinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: listen to the children, listen to the monitor, listen to the nurses, to the young and old caregiver teams, and listen to the parents.
All of this needs to be done not only to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly gather much information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in the care of children are everywhere, and of course in intensive care as well.
Listening and talking stimulates a deeper understanding, both on the part of the caring staff and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true in looking at an entire system.
The more in-depth and rigorous understanding there is, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, the better suited to the situation, and most importantly – early enough to prevent future, immediate or distant damage.
That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspirational character to me.
He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, to listen - and then to apply.

Medical Malpractice at Different Birth Stages
In order to win damages, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused due to the same negligence
Birth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in a family's life.
Unfortunately, however, births sometimes result in serious damage caused to the birther or newborn as a result of medical staff negligence.
In cases where the birth ended with bodily harm, the newborn or the mother, there is room to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
An attorney specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there have been any flaws in the medical staff's conduct during the various birth stages which have caused damage and the more he sees fit, the more he turns to consult with a medical specialist in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment on the part of the medical staff arises to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that the binge was negligent.
When is it negligent?
When the doctor's error was due to incompetence or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused had the doctor not done so.
In this article we will examine the various birth stages, explain what complications may occur in each of the stages and when they arise to medical malpractice.
Axis phase
The axial phase lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.
At this point the cervix gradually opens (to allow the embryo to pass at the time of birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most cases of medical negligence during the labor phase deal with the failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which has caused damage to the newborn that is sometimes even manifested in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by a non-recognition or delayed detection of a subnatal stimulator, which is manifested in an oxygen supply failure to the fetal brain tissue.
As a rule, monitoring the birthing mother's condition and correct deciphering of the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of fetal distress development, allowing the medical team to act quickly and extract the newborn before being irreversibly injured.
Cases in which the medical team ignores signs that indicate the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or that the team is not correctly interpreting the data in front of it and in particular the fetal monitor or reacting late to the distress expressed in the monitor – can be negligent.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by the fall of the umbilical cord as well as a ruptured uterus that has not been detected in a timely manner.
Even in these difficult events, it is worthwhile to find out whether the medical team has acted properly.
For example, Adv. Anna Rafe Liganza, of Caspi Sror & Co., who specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her office handled the claim of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetus' head was too high, thus leading to the fall of the umbilical cord (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetus' head) and to damage the oxygen supply to the fetus's brain (as a result of severe injury of the umbilical cord).
In another case, the lawyer said that her office had filed a claim due to severe medical negligence of the maternity ward staff in a large hospital which during the birth did not identify at the time clear signs that necessitated a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scarring area of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus that was ejaculated through the rupture in its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until its rescue late on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child had a complex neurological disability.
It should be emphasized that in order to win compensation, plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the negligence of the medical staff that resulted in the failure to identify the defect and the damage caused to the newborn, i.e. that the damage was caused due to said negligence and not by any other reason or factor.
The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical indicators that according to the medical literature only in their existence there is a causal link between the abstinence and the brain injury.
Among other things, the measures of the pH level in the fetus' blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic injury, and more are examined.
The passing of the fetus
The active birth stage
The active birth stage begins when the cervical opening reaches a diameter of 10 cm and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical phase.
Suspension at birth and avoidance of carrying out a cesarean section
In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., lack of progress of the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damage that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
"There are cases where failure to perform a caesarean section on time may cause irreparable damage to the fetus," Attorney Rafe-Liganza explained to us.
"For example, we have conducted a medical malpractice claim of neonatal death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
Contrary to any recognized medical practice, the medical staff were not able to identify the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite particularly slow progress of birth.
The delay in performing the operation caused multiple systemic damage to the birthing system which eventually led to her death shortly after her birth."
Malpractice at a vacuum birth
In situations where a mother or fetus faces a significant danger requiring a particularly rapid termination of birth, a vacuum birth (empty shulpan) is sometimes performed.
In this process, a "dome" vacuum is attached to the embryo's head and forcefully pulls out the embryo.
Naturally, this action involves risks and can cause damage to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great caution, accuracy and skill.
In these events medical malpractice may be manifested in the fact that the doctor does not follow the binding guidelines and carries out the action despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer period of time than is permitted or when despite the failure of numerous attempts, the doctor continues to repeat the action more than the number of attempts allowed.
In these cases if the negligent vacuum operation has caused the newborn damage – among other things, it can cause skull damage and bleeding that can cause brain damage – there is room for a tort claim to be filed.
ERB Named Paralysis
Irv's palsy is an innate nerve injury to the brachial plexus (a nerve junction connecting the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during labor it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetrician team.
The injury manifests itself in the weakness of the hand muscles and can reach up to full paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a'shoulder-bleed' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders are locked inside the birth canal after its head has been out.
When should you suspect that paralysis is the result of medical negligence?
In cases where assessing the weight of the fetus indicated that it is a macarosomal fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born at a weight exceeding 4.5 kilograms and in accordance with the guidelines it is preferable to deliver the mother by cesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors including gestational diabetes and the second stage of delivery.
In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue vaginal birth and realizes the risk of shoulder arrhythmia and ERB paralysis, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.
Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court held that "the risk of shoulder stenosis occurring during labor can be foreseen to one degree or another of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a concern of its occurrence, is by conducting a cesarean section".
Placental exit phase
Separating the placenta from the uterus and excreting it occurs due to uterine contraction after the newborn exit and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process usually lasts up to half an hour from the time of the baby's departure and usually occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the placenta exit, the medical team will check to see if it has come out intact or if any placenta parts remain in the uterus.
As part of this phase, complications may occur that may cause serious damage to the mother.
One of the known complications as a result of remaining placental residues in the uterus is called "Aschermann's syndrome", the scarring of the uterine wall resulting from inflammation caused by leaving placental residues in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine mucosa in a way that does not allow for the implantation of pregnancy.
Therefore, in cases in which the medical team did not identify that any placenta residue remained or did not take all measures to prevent uterine mucosa injury despite the suspicion that placenta residue in the uterus may have been medical negligence and the case is worthy of a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
The Birthing Death
The death of a child during childbirth is a fairly rare euro.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family unfortunately becomes the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother on time or respond late to such bleeding.
"For example...", said Attorney Rafe-Ligenza, "our office filed a claim concerning the death of a child, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the worrisome vital signs of the birthing mother, for long hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease she was suffering from."
"In another case...", said attorney Rafe-Liganza, "our office represented the relatives of a woman who died after the birth of twins due to bleeding that originated in the C-section that was not sewn properly.
In the same case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, responding late only after her body systems began to collapse, which resulted in her death."
Loss of uterus
In severe cases, medical malpractice at birth may lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Rafe Lingza: "Our firm conducted a lawsuit against a hospital that is based on hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.
In the same case, a 31-year-old woman lost her uterus due to the lack of adequate treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after birth and was nevertheless not taken during the actions that could have prevented the damage."
What are the damages awarded in medical malpractice claims at birth?
Newborn compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and suffering, nursing and wage care, loss of wages and pension to the injured and even to his parents and other damage components.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for salary and pension losses is calculated in most cases based on the average wage in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adjusting housing for the needs of the baby, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined in each case and according to its circumstances," says Attorney Rafe-Liganza, and she further states that "today most claims on the grounds of medical malpractice are supplemented by a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in the management of the proceeding," but the lawyer added that "there are cases in which the proceeding ends only in a judgment, so if the claim is not denied, the plaintiffs will receive a full compensation for all their damages and, for example, in a court case that has been conducted."
In conclusion
Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.
In these cases a proper legal examination of the chain of events that resulted in the tragic outcome, by a skilled attorney in the management of claims on the grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the south
A study found that there is a link between the development of the disease and the marriage of relatives
The highest incidence was found in the Bedouin sector
Expert: "It is possible that in any sector with many weddings between cousins, there is a high incidence of the disease."
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some vision impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and find proper solutions to prevent worsening of the condition.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted to help understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies give a research basis for suspicion of keratoconus eye disease being a genetic disease.
A recent study, which dealt with transforming the shape of the cornea from a dome to an engraver, found that the cause of the disease and weakness of the cornea and its deformation is associated with an enzyme imbalance, which could result in free radicals damaging the proteins in the cornea – and its structure will change.
The source of this enzyme deficiency is genetic, a fact that reinforces the hypothesis that keratocanus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shag, head of the Optometric Sciences Department at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, the prevalence of keratoconus was found to be 3.2%.
The highest incidence was among students from the Bedouin sector – 20% had keratoconus, but there was a small relative sample."
The researcher added that this is an unsurprising finding: "There is a large prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies we found that close marriages are a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
So in any sector with lots of weddings between cousins, we may find high prevalence."
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where a family history of keratoconus disease appears, all family members should undergo a proper eye exam as soon as possible.
According to Arza Prochter, a B.Sc. clinical optometrist, "there is a tenfold appeal to the clinic from remote periphery areas, mainly from the southern region, versus the center".
Fruchter adds that "in the past decade I have noticed that most patients are evacuated from the periphery, especially from the Beersheba area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriage within the family (mainly in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of proper treatment of the problem."
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Prochter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or late teens (ages 16-15 or 20).
The disease includes a decrease in vision, parallel to an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients indicate distorted and/or blurred vision of characters and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which often develops slowly and gradually over the years.
However, the disease may also develop at a rapid rate and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many patients even show increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza - the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel"
Mahmoud Khair al-Din of the village of Hurfish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in an operation in Khan Yunis
Head of Military Intelligence: "He deserves the publicity, his family and his children"
Later on, the possibility of publishing Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno's photograph from the General Staff Patrol will be examined.
About three and a half years after the operation that took place in Khan Yunis, the IDF today permits the publication that the killed in the operation, Lt. Col. M, is the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair ad-Din from the village of Hurfish in the north.
He was 41 years old in Nuplo.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "It has been three and a half years since the late Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hir al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to state security.
"Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper patrol and later grew up in the army ranks to be a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's Special Operations Division.
The hero of Israel who was decorated after his death in the IDF Chief of Staff."
He also said: "I told him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have a right to know him, the name and face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hir Al-Din, openly.
The environment looked up to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion conducted by the head of the intelligence division, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censors, and with the consent of his family members, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Hurfish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and Nasira, with seven brothers and sisters.
He's a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahad and father of two sons.
He served as an officer, combatant and commander in the Special Operations Division of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khir ad-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.
By 9th grade, he was attending school in the village of Hurfish, and then moved to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in a paratroopers' cruiser, and in 2000 he graduated from the Officers' School.
In 2002 he was located by the Special Operations Directorate in A.N. and moved to serve there.
During his service, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he established with his friends an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined Aharai and began to guide a group in the village of Hurfish, after he made sure that the organization would start operating in the Druze villages to encourage youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
Military Intelligence Chief Colonel Aharon Haliva explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "It is time we become on the issue of exposing the name of Mahmoud Khair ad-Din, the hero of Israel.
We finished work and came to the conclusion that there is no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
It also deserves him, his family and his children," he noted.
"Extraordinary Educator and Leader"
"Thanks to many operations he is nothing short of a hero in my eyes," said Chaliva champion.
"He has a significant contribution, which has courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He deserves to have the right place for him."
He added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator, educator and leader - not only on the operational side, but also on my values."
General Haliva noted that he would also later examine whether to publish the photograph of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno of the General Staff Patrol, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and his picture was not allowed to be published.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on 11 November 2018.
The operation was the culmination of long months of meticulous preparations that the intelligence community took part in.
In the command squad of the operation sat the then Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, then Head of Military Intelligence, Major General Tamir Heyman and then Chief of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been allowed to be published, and the IDF has emphasized that this is an action whose intelligence value is invaluable.
But in the Arab media, hindsight radio equipment was presented that, according to the Palestinians, was left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was intended to install listening devices.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the force was traveling in two vehicles.
The fighters were arrested at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas members, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The field investigation took about 45 minutes, during which time it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair ad-Din managed to distract Hamas members, and in a split second the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A, was able to open fire.
From the fire, three Hamas members were killed, and unfortunately, Lt. Col. Khir al-Din was also killed.
Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the citation committee and grant the Chief of Staff's commendation to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - including the late Lt. Col. Khir al-Din.
The commander of the combat force and another combatant on the team were also given a commendation.
The army said in a statement at the time that Lt. Col. M had received the commendation "for his activity in the operation with his crew, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, for the protection of his comrades.
He then acted out of initiative and striving for touch, taking a forward role in taking over the enemy and acting resourcefully to advance the takeover.
Consider moving from tweezer operations to extensive operation
Israel needs to ask itself, again, if it is wrong to change policy vis--vis the Jenin sector
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would fuel and ignite the West Bank, but that Jenin gunmen might leave it no choice.
The stormy weekend we've been through teaches that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the territory is still more volatile than ever.
It will take great effort and common sense to pass through the two upcoming memorials: the Nakba Day which is today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day which will be celebrated in two weeks.
Quite a few factors will stand by in an attempt to torpedo back into sanity.
In their heads, as always, are the elements of terrorism, which concentrate a special effort in an attempt to preserve the violent atmosphere of the past few weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which a SWAT fighter was killed two days ago, the late Brig. Gen. Noam Raz.
Fighters who took part in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a scope of shooting and violence – evidence not only of the enormous amount of weapons on the ground, but also of the willingness to use it.
This requires Israel to ask itself, again, if it is wrong to change policy vis--vis the Jenin sector, and to move from small, intelligence-based tweezers to a mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would fuel and ignite the West Bank and the entire arena in its wake; even now, the defense establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, in order to avoid incendiary action, but Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
Produce the lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Aqla.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those who attend the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of combatants.
This is indicative of high morals, but it also has an operational-intelligence value: a terrorist who was captured aliveas happened in Jenin the day beforeis an excellent source of information about weapons, attacks and other terrorists; this is information that is usually not otherwise obtainable, and through which the next attacks can be thwarted.
The IDF acted correctly when it published its interim investigation into Abu Aqla's death yesterday, making it clear that it was not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the affair.
In any case, nothing seems to convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism – the original ground on which the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories perish.
World public opinion is busy with ripeness and moving on, certainly as Ukraine continues to rampage a much more intense war.
Therefore, it is a pity that Israel insisted on giving the affair of Abu Aqla's death more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful treatment of her funeral.
Even if Abu 'Aqla's family did not live up to the early summaries, there should have been a little more braking ability expected from the policemen who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less excitement from the Palestinian flags that were raised there.
Responsibilities: Act to calm the situation.
Good did the Minister of Homeland Security and the Police Commissioner who ordered the investigation of the incident.
It seems to lack sufficient preparation and clear instructions, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
Also in the attack in Dizengof, the police failed to manage the incident, isolate the scene, and handle the media.
The Commission of Inquiry will do well not only to analyze the conduct of police officers at the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that will allow for more successful handling of similar events in the future.
Alongside the internal handling of the police, it also undertakes to give consideration to the conduct of elected officials who have lost way and direction.
In the Knesset, Israel currently serves several members who appear to be a danger to democracy.
They are on the left and right, using their immunity not to challenge the country, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kasif is the latest example of this; if no measures are taken against him – including a prosecution for assaulting a police officer – the state will encourage the next elected official to further officer his actions.
Such moves, which are a defensive democracy, are essential in the explosiveness of this period, with elements in the background seeking to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with common sense in their head is expected to rise above all of these, and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel could quickly slide into escalation in the face of enemies from outside, and worse, in the face of domestic adversaries.
Police official: "Government policy and goal setting are needed here"
Israel Police may have launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal aliens, but the road is still long
There is not a single factor in the State of Israel that includes this whole issue."
"If you want to address the phenomenon of illegal aliens, government policy is required, and from it goals, tasks, and responsibilities must be derived.
Today there is no single party in the State of Israel that includes this entire issue," a senior police official told Israel Today.
Until a month and a half ago, prior to the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was expressed in about 20,000 to 30,000 NIS that enter daily through the breaches in the fence.
In addition, between 100 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter work daily in Israel through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each branch is limited in the quota set by the political echelon in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
Permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, the Shin Bet is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to terrorist attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians whose entry was forbidden because they do not meet the quota of permits allowed.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengof and Balad were indeed considered to be Shin Bet, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security officials to monitor their movements.
"Therefore there is no significance to their entry through the breaches in the fence," says a senior security official, "Those who wish to carry out an attack can enter the country through the supervised crossings as well, and there have been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
In the wake of the attack in Elad and in light of multiple alerts to the attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal residents.
By the end of the week, 16,000 people had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened for them, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against an illegal detainee are only carried out against criminals who stumble or people who repeat the act repeatedly (recidivists).
An illegal resident who was arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
This is sometimes repeated a second time as well, but only a third time has he been arrested, jailed, and indicted for illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal resident is caught within 50 to 100 meters of either side of the separation fence, treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.
Data that reached Israel Hayom shows that in 2021, 40,010 illegal residents were treated by the police, from traveller and melamines.
7,405 illegal aliens have been arrested and 19,533 have opened a criminal case.
The number of employers, conveyors and lenders treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
"The foundations of the Shin Bet phenomenon are not dependent on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society and not on Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors," says a senior law enforcement official.
"In order to address this phenomenon, they must be motivated to go out to work in Israel, and on the Israeli side, they must be charged a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the matter argue that failure to collect the price is due, among other things, to a lack of places of detention and the fact that arrests are only made when there are related offences or that it is a recidivist.
Legal officials claim that the decision to exact a price from Shin Bet only starting from its third arrest was also made in part because the courts cannot deal with the number of arrests being made every day.
Anyone who examines the punishment will also find that it is not deterring."
There is great complexity
Shabak," says a police official, "is a complex man."
He could be the father of a family that came into the country to work to earn a few shekels and come back.
This is the basic platform, on which many types of Shin Bets are dressed to enter the country in order to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks."
It may be adult or minor.
In the past, police have caught illegal 16-year-olds and even children 8 and 10 years old sent by their parents to road intersections to earn a few shekels a day from customs.
"It also makes the matter complicated, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and charge them with neglect," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical works or advanced construction works.
In the past, there were also local authorities who employed incursions in garbage disposals, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 major crossings.
There are passages of vehicles and goods, there are passages that pass through only people and there are passages that are both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the transit authority.
The ISAs are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as this is easy money.
"There are those who do this for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is the transportation of shalabim," a senior police official says, "usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can reach 100 shekels up to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies do not engage in this, because if the company is caught, it is doomed to close."
Police emphasize that under certain conditions, the passage of the ISA can be considered an offence.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who collects Palestinians at fixed points and at regular hours, including an orderly reservation, does not break the law," says a senior police official, "who knows that he drives ISA, usually picks them up in the middle of the night at hiding points, including downloading at hidden points.
Most of these guys drive a car from Chukmec because they know they're being impounded so they'd rather ride in an old car."

The territories suffer from many arsons, with the damage at tens of thousands of shekels
In this focus, the "new guard" was established in an attempt to eradicate the difficult phenomenon
(Laughs)
In the documentation that reached "Israel Hayom" you can see grazing areas in the seat of birds that are on fire.
The grasslands are of Zilberman life.
The territories suffer from many arsons, with damage amounting to tens of thousands of shekels.
It should be noted that in this focus the "new guard" was established in an attempt to eradicate the difficult phenomenon.

Terrorists threw explosives at IDF soldiers, who returned fire and killed one of them
Security forces arrested 13 wanted men across Judea and Samaria tonight
During the operation, an IDF force fired at a number of suspects who threw explosives at them, an impact was identified
The director of the hospital in Jenin, to which the terrorist, Maher Marai, 25 years old from Jenin, is reported to have been shot by IDF fire.
IDF, Shin Bet and Border Police forces arrested 13 wanted people throughout Judea and Samaria on Wednesday night.
The forces operated in several locations throughout the Judea and Samaria Division to arrest wanted persons, among others in the village of Rashida and in the city of Nablus.
In the operations of the fighters in the city of Jenin in the area of the Manasseh Regional Brigade, two wanted persons suspected of terrorist activity were arrested.
In addition, during the activity, an IDF force fired at a number of suspects who threw explosives at them, there were sounds of gunfire in the area.
Impact detected.
The director of the hospital in Jenin, to which the terrorist, Maher Marai, 25, from the Jenin refugee camp, is reported to have been shot by IDF fire, leading to his death.
During the activities of IDF fighters in the Al-Azra refugee camp in the area of the Etzion Regional Brigade for the arrest of a wanted person suspected of terrorist activity and the seizure of weapons, a number of suspects were identified who threw stones at the force, who responded with measures to disperse demonstrations and shoot Ruger.
Impact detected.
In addition, arrests were also made in the village of Silwad east of Ramallah, and three students from the "Al-Islamiya Kotel" were arrested in their homes, the list that is affiliated with Hamas at the University of Anjah in Nablus, and which recently saw violent clashes with Fatah students and security forces on campus.
"A criminal investigation should be launched against her": Haifa City Comptroller on serious charges against Einat Kalish Rotem
The city comptroller's report presents an apparent concern for the criminal conduct of Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former city officials and political opponents: employee surveillance and inflated payment to an accountant's office for carrying out the investigations
"The hard findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation"
The City of Haifa received no response.
Surveillance of city employees and political opponents and inflated payment to an accountant's office for carrying out the investigations, "at the expense of the public register".
A report by Haifa Municipality Comptroller Ofer Tal published yesterday (Tuesday), presents an apparent fear of criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
According to the suspicion, Kalish met with the accounting firm of Barlev & Co. and asked for an investigative review.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former city treasurer, and a code name given to councilwoman Sophie Nakash, and examined whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family are kosher to Mehadrin.
It also emerges from the auditor's report that there is a complete disorder and lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kleish met.
The city treasurer is the municipal official whose job is to concentrate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments and the data collected by the accountant were not transferred to him.
This meant that no one in the municipality was aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and the scope of work required in each of them.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant have not been confirmed in many cases as required.
A situation was created in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved increased disproportionately, with great intervention in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and surveillance from the municipality.
At the conclusion of the report, the review recommended stopping the unpaid payments to the accountant until material was received detailing his work on each of the issues examined.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as "Gatekeepers", an information store, a fish shop, an investigative review for the mayor and a procurement investigative review report.
Shortly thereafter, the city's attorney, Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself had signed the payment confirmation in its place.
"Not invited by any review report and I don't know what it's about," she wrote.
It was also revealed that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remain to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.
Former city treasurer Jackie Vakim responded: "These despicable acts that were done for the purpose of tarnishing my name and the name of elected officials at the expense of the public register and the Haifa taxpayer and is a criminal offense."
Sophie asked the city councilwoman in her response: "The reviewer's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."
The response of attorney Sarit Golan, a member of the Haifa City Council: The testimonies and hard findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the investigative review consultant to carry out investigations, which are doubtful as to some of which are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out and in particular the investigations relating to the council member from the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees."
Lior Detz's response from Gatekeepers: "It seems that all the red lines that a public authority sends investigators are being crossed in order to gather information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption and while the association is conducting public proceedings against the Haifa municipality management."
The City of Haifa did not give a response.
Accountant Yehuda Barlev's office is not interested in commenting.
Gantz revealed that "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNIFIL operations in Lebanon"
The Minister of Defense participated in the International Cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University, claiming that "Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modes of operation"
Gantz referred, among other things, to Al-Sayyid's documentation of Hamas captivity: "a video aimed at extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue"
8200 Unit's deputy commander revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke this morning (Wednesday) at the International Cyber Conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah in order to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country," Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayyid, who was captured by Hamas in Gaza, which the military wing of the terrorist organization released: "Yesterday a video was posted aimed at extortion – on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas holds the four boys captive against international law, against morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal conduct of Hamas."
He added that "the State of Israel is acting through a variety of means, and continues to turn every stone in order to bring the boys home.
As we have said before – this is a humanitarian issue, as we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act.
Blackmail attempts and mind exercises will not affect our position and conduct."
Later on, he revealed joint Iranian and Hezbollah activities: "Iran is also operating its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today, which recently detected Iranian security forces' activity in cooperation with Hezbollah, in order to harm UNIFIL forces' activities in Lebanon.
This was done by implementing a cyber operation aimed at stealing materials on UNIFIL deployment in the region, and using them by Hezbollah.
This is another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon, and to Lebanon's stability."
"Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modes of operation.
We have seen in recent years the phenomenon of Iranian hacker groups operating against Israel and other countries," Gantz continued.
"The 'New Messengers' are terrorists with a keyboard who are condemned like other terrorist organizations' fighters.
We know who they are, we hurt them and their senders, and even today they are in our sights – and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack against the citizens of Israel will be put on the agenda.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and the country that funds and sends them.
Cyberattacks can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and in other areas."
Gantz continued the attack on the nuclear power: "Iran is leading cyber terrorism - and is making moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and administrations, as has happened in the United States presidential election and other attempts Israel is aware of.
Actions such as that of the Shahid Kawah unit, which collected information about ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under a direct directive by the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards as revealed in the investigations."
He added that "in recent years we have stopped many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand a ‘cybernetic responsibility,' and to punish companies and bodies that do not follow the guidelines."
Gantz went on to mark Israel's next goals in the face of threats: "Our top mission, in the military, in the industries and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and leave them.
Me and the Chief of Staff placed this issue as one of the central tasks in the relevant units.
We examine the power building all the time – both in the scope of personnel, both in the subject of training and in the subject of tasks.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system."
Finally, the defense minister concluded, calling for cooperation with the world: "There is great importance to our cooperation with the world vis--vis Iran in the cyber dimension as well.
"The same cooperation we are building in the region vis--vis Iran in terms of defense vis--vis various threats - we are expanding in the cyber dimension as well."
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems."
Uri, the deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at such conferences, revealing that Israel had foiled an attack on the water systems.
"Cyber threat prevention is a key part of our operations.
Our goal is to achieve superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and act to negate his abilities," said Lt. Commander 8200, adding "so we sometimes also find victims outside of Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and through collaboration with industry and other agencies, through the application and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed."
As stated above, a threat was exposed to Israel's water systems and attempts to poison Israel's citizens: "We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a certain opponent attacked Israel and in the process, we identified that the same attacker also tried to target power plants in the United States.
This was the first indication of this attack.
This threat we were able to prevent through close cooperation with our American partners."
Watch: This is how police prepare to eliminate terrorists in civilian population
The Jerusalem Border Police are inaugurating a new "Asaf" facility that simulates shooting at a crowded crowd in response to the sequence of attacks that have taken place in recent months
Border Patrol's terror-fighting guide envelops Jerusalem: "The development, provides a relevant response to the threats of attribution and simulates the reality on the ground"
A peek into the Asaf facility
Preparing for the next attack: a string of terrorist attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were murdered and about 70 civilians were injured, led the Border Patrol to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to storm terrorists within a civilian population and carry out shootings in the movement.
Exposing "Israel Hayom": A glimpse into the "Asaf" facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary to lead a normal life of a civilian population.
The wave of violent attacks that took place this year, with attacks in Beersheba, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was assimilated into a crowd, led the police to creative thinking for the purpose of developing a tool that could be used to train fighters to storm terrorists within a civilian population.
The work of thinking was led by the Police and Border Patrol Training Wing.
These came out in competition in the various police districts under the title "Learning Leading Commanders", in which each district was required to develop measures to help improve the policing and fighting skills of the fighters, police officers and commanders.
In the framework of the competition, and in response to the need to train Border Police fighters to combat the practice of firing in traffic and in these types of scenarios, Asaf Ben David, a terrorist combat instructor for the Jerusalem Border Patrol, developed the Asaf facility, consisting of a dynamic target, which is attached to a telescopic pole on which consists of a carrier that can be harnessed to the guide.
Their servant who guides the carrier to our death, he can practice the warrior who stands before him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Patrol fighters and fighters have faced many attacks including the bomber, carrying out shootings and threatening while moving in arenas saturated with innocent civilians.
The Assaf facility, in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the upgraded and integrated telescopic rod at the facility was taken from the area of maintenance and cleanliness.
Through the facility it is possible to simulate firing in traffic within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling the movement brake, choosing a path forward making selective firing including practice of preventing harm to the uninvolved.
Maj. Gen. Asaf Ben David, whose facility is named after him, says: "The facility we have developed, is a breakthrough in learning and training fighters and police officers.
The development, provides a relevant response to the threats of attribution and simulates reality on the ground.
The benefit of development against the relatively cheap cost of production is a significant advantage for us in competition."
State Comptroller Warns: "Central Election Commission Not Prepared for Cyber Threats"
Netanyahu Engelman Warns International Cyber Week Against Israel's Unwillingness to Bombardment Attacks
"World War III will be a hacker war but the world is not prepared for it."
State Comptroller Matanyahu Engelman participated today (Wednesday) in the annual cyber conference of Tel Aviv University and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it."
Engelman said that in the framework of the cyber audits that his office is conducting, significant deficiencies were found: "In the past year we have carried out penetration checks at the Traffic Management Center in Jerusalem, in hospitals and in the tax authority systems.
In the reviews we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were carried out by public bodies and some only conducted penetration tests during the audit.
In addition, there have been deficiencies in the preparedness of the Central Election Commission for Cyber Threats."
"We at the State Comptroller's Office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue more fully, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world," he concluded.
Aiming high: "I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles"
Choosing Reds: "From the first moment I was shown wanting me, I was built to lead a big team"
Returning to the Israel national team after four years: "I felt I had a place, I wanted to be on the roster for Eurobasket"
And the time in Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to concentrate only on what I control"
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with Israel national team players to Poland, where they will meet the local team at the 2023 World Championships qualifiers (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia in the Solomon Group Hall.
At the same time as his intensive training with the team, Blazer dealt with his future for the past week as well, until he signed for two years at Hapoel Jerusalem.
"I have a quiet mind now that I have found a group," he tells Israel Today in a first and special interview since the signing.
"I have a bit of pressure right now because I have to move out with the family after we've settled in the center area and it's not easy, but there are no phones anymore and professionally I'm much calmer."
You haven't been on the team in four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to have fun on the team and I come up with an attitude of donating everything I can, whether it's from my experience or whether it's on the field.
Of course I would love to play, but when you get to the team everyone has to put the ego aside and do everything in order for the team to succeed.
I'm here for what they need from me."
Now you're 14 players, and for the European Championship will be joined by Danny Abdia, Gaby Chachaashvili will be back, and there may also be other changes.
That you set out to be on the roster for the championship?
"I would love to be on the field and contribute."
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99 m) has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv for the past two years.
When the season ended it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks moved to the capital, preferring Jerusalemites to Hapoel Holon.
You had other suggestions, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
"They showed a very big willingness for me to be there, so there was relatively little negotiation.
As soon as I felt connected with the management and the coach I realized that this was the right place for me.
The situation seems good and appropriate to me as well.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I talked to the coach and he has a hard work and win mentality, and that's exactly what I bring.
I've always loved playing Arena, because I get energies well with the crowd is against me, and now that they're on my side it'll be even better.
I'm sure there will be a committed and fun team and I wanted to be a part of it."
Talk a little more about your conversation with Coach Dziki.
"Professionally he believes in a lot of motion without a ball, he plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energies in defense and attack and with the audience in Arena it can succeed."
I looked at your career and saw that each team stayed for at least two years, if not longer.
Do you feel that you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years as well?
"Everywhere I come I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate it.
From the moment I signed up in Jerusalem, my phone kept ringing and beeping.
I got a lot of messages already waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good time ahead of us."
Do you think in Jerusalem you can be a more significant player than in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you sum up the two years in the TA Maccabi?
"There were some things I couldn't control last season.
Everyone saw that I had remained a professional all along, and no matter how much I got, I always gave everything.
I'm proud of the way I've done this past year, and now everyone's on their way."
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in the Maccabi?
"After the last year it was clear to both sides that we were going in the direction of a breakup, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I was a little hurt in the minutes and my standing declined, although in the middle of the year I had an excellent period, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I realized the situation there, I realized it was less of a place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it."
In conclusion, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what was in the semi-finals last season when I yelled to Ami Biton (the manager of the team at Maccabi Tel Aviv - 19) 'That's what I'm here for,' so that's why I came to Jerusalem - to take titles."

All or Nothing: 1:1 Between the Worker Jerusalem and the Worker Hadera
Guy Hadida scored his own goal in the 33rd minute but was able to fix it with a tie 10 minutes later
Later, the knot was removed in questionable red (74)
Hadera also stayed in ten players following Red to the duty of Ido Levy (87)
The professional staff of Hapoel Jerusalem counted the evening (Saturday night) well the amount of foreigners on the lawn in Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at one point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was banned).
This time, to their delight, everything was in order, and the 1:1 that they obtained against the worker Hadera would not be taken away from them by the tribunal of the Association.
Before the red he had absorbed was sharpened, he had managed to conquer a self-gate and compare to arrange a valuable point for Ziv Arya.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Plakuschenko raised to the floor, and the midfielder stepped up and headed back and the ball stopped in his team's net.
1-0 to her room that enjoyed a self-gate of the knot.
Ten minutes after the self-gate, Hadida was able to repair and hugely - Levkovich caught air and this time the knot was rammed into the right and exposed grid.
1:1 on Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to register a second yellow and red, this time after sliding in Marmentini's direction.
Daniel Bar Nathan decided on a shady red and sent the knot straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan also sent Ido Levy in red and balanced the power relations on the grass as well.
Recovery Department: Eilat Defeated Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Halami's team composed a third win in a row, this time particularly impressive
Huber and Schuchmann (15 h) excelled
The recovery journey of Hapoel Eilat continues this evening (Saturday) with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a 0:3 seasonal balance sheet in the encounters between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Beit Halami's team has already had three straight wins, and in fact this is only a surprise for those who didn't see the game.
We haven't seen such bad weather in a long time.
All this before the start of the series against Bashikatash in the play-offs in the Champions Cup: just 60 points, first half without three and 11 percent for three in the entire game.
Bottom line, an unimpressive evening of all the team's players (with the exception of Murphy Manko, who scored the three-pointers of Holon), including the safe stock Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in great shape thanks to the shepherds of Huber and Joaquin Schuchman (15 p.m.).
The first came back to itself in recent times and the second came back to bloom and also amazed with a basket of three-quarters of a lot.
Give them a chance: The Israelis of Maccabi Tel Aviv saved Spropolos
After a loss to Derby and eighth consecutively in Europe, classico discriminated against Jerusalem – apparently, she would have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach.
So who does Yannis have to send a bouquet to tonight?
His Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points in Arena
Also: Why should the Yellow Club change the 'Americanization Strategy', and take a vivid example from Ariel Beit Halami's model in Eilat
It is difficult to remain cynical at the sight of the teary eyes and the warm and strong embraces that Yanis Spropolus gave his players at the end of the game tonight in Arne, and especially in the face of the tight grip and the secret exchange with John Dethrolamau, who single-handedly saved the Greek coach the job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after a home loss in Derby and a continuous eighth in Europe, losing also in Classico to Jerusalem and staying away from it to three wins in the table?
This would have ended the Israeli-Greek novel by tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, both and essentially about the EuroLeague.
First, the Tel Aviv Maccabi came with a radical change in the attacking and moving habits of the ball.
The ball moved with devotion, with a lot of movement and exercises, and Scotty Wilbkin, in a demonstrated manner, left the focus to Evans, dribbled very little, and mostly went through blocks and went out for shots.
Although a very bad scorer (2-9 from the field), Wilbkin contributed on defense, and most of all, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to the old habits, and the attacks went back to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2 and 40 second lead to the end, Scotty dribbled himself in half a corner and threw a flutter at one leg that nearly lost the game.
The trick is to keep playing drills and devotional movements precisely in the clutch moments, and it must go into the nature and group DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who became water-pullers and towel-waving at games in Europe.
Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them more than half the team's points (42 out of 83), and were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of the top five scenes in Maccabi were its Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in EuroLeague.
In the first half it was mostly oz Blazer, which Section had been screaming for a month that he had to play more.
Shooter, Morale, Undersleeves Warrior (7 rebounds), 2 feet of defensive determination and game wisdom.
Isn't that enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen starred, with excellent percentages of all ranges, cool off the line, and covering for Zhei's injury, and especially John Dee, who, in a 70:63 situation, changed momentum with five consecutive points.
If Yiftach Ziv has a complex relationship, and sometimes seems to give him too much credit, overloading him too much, to the point of risking losing.
It's happening in the EuroLeague too, and it's happened tonight.
But the important learning should be the club's, about its Americanization strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or perhaps was rejected by Maccabi.
And this happens because in Maccabi there remain gradually fewer places for Israelis, because of an informed and rooted choice of the club to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play in it, and then she will look for Jewish children to be naturalized, and press the manager/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake of the club.
And the game that we saw should remind Maccabi that it exaggerates with the foreigners, much because of the tax discount.
It is certainly not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediums, you can have five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nanley, Evans, Reynolds, and Tilor, it was possible to bring two stars (star hub and super forward) effective and stable near Scotty and Zyi.
It will be more effective, it will be more true, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and generates solidarity.
It is true that there are two busy frameworks and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which purports to represent Israel, and even receive tax relief from the state for its so-called representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League Manager can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 Form, max three on the field at the same time.
Is it for the ongoing failed achievements (seven years in Europe), just for the Maccabi, that the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the player organization, how about you?
For that you've been staying?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there's one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Negotiate to get less?
The previous Russian rule was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the above direction, the worker Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 other Israelis who were only second in the junior squads (Huber, Ben Moshe, Rowena and Schuchman the Warrior), she disbanded Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in two weeks.
It is a tradition in Eilat to play well with three foreigners, because there was such a run even in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot in the days of Sharon Drucker.
The short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is nothing like Ariel Beit Halami, who started on the open fields in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their best, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners are just making up.
When Ben Carter and Casey Frather come back from the knee injury, it'll be a great team.
A song I dreamt of Eilat.
And that Maccabee can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow Celebrations: "There was a feeling that the whole world was against us"
The Yellows are happy after the 78:83 on Hapoel Jerusalem in Arena: "We are back to playing as Maccabi Tel Aviv should play"
About Ami Biton's conversation in the dressing room, the first optimistic diagnosis of ii's injury and the management's approval of the purchase.
A great sense of relief was recorded this morning among the Maccabi Tel Aviv people after the important and prestigious 78:83 yesterday in Erna on Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team's players and management members hugged coach Giannis Speropoulos who seemed very excited at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer enthusiastically poured water on the top-rated Derrick Williams in the game, and the rest of the club also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the last losing streak.
They too were afraid of defeat in the face of the great rivalry that would further destabilize the system.
Fans also had long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
"There is an amazing connection between us and Yanis in the dressing room," Oz Blazer said.
"We know that the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We've been looking forward to it a lot, even in the way we've been playing.
We are back to playing in a way that Maccabi Tel Aviv needs to play in, with a heart and fight, we stand behind it.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us."
Prior to the game, team manager Ami Biton entered the locker room and carried exciting things to the players.
"His things had a great impact on how we came out and how we played on the court," said players at Maccabi.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi are already aiming for the important match against Basconia on Thursday and want to cut the long losing streak in the EuroLeague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last few games we were under a lot of pressure, Janis told us that if we were released we would win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
A lot of eyes on us and it was a feeling of the whole world against us, I am proud to go to this war, we are cutting off everyone around us and looking only at ourselves."
Ante ii who was injured in his right knee during the last quarter was examined by the medical staff in the dressing room and the initial diagnosis was not severe.
Doctors will examine how the knee will react today and then find out how many days of rest it will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will qualify for Basconia.
With the exception of the strong backing given from the management to Speropolus and the professional staff, in a meeting held on Thursday, the professional director Nikola Wojcic was given a green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, and the yellows hope to soon add quality acquisition.
Anthony Bennett freed from Jerusalem laborer
The forward who was selected first in the NBA draft failed to acclimate to the team from the capital
The club broke up: "Anthony enters the hearts of all of us, thanking him for the period in practice."
About four months after he signed with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released today (Sunday) from the team's roster.
The forward (28, 2.03) who was drafted first in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers recorded 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five Champions League games as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight Premier League games.
"Worker Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision on the authorisation of the player's contract with the club," the club said, "Anthony has entered the hearts of all of us and we would like to thank him for his time in the club.
Wishing him well and good luck."
Study states: Zoom meetings hurt creativity
Around 2,100 engineers and academics around the world have been asked to develop solutions to the problem – some in video sessions, some in face-to-face meetings.
The result: a virtual meeting impairs creativity and thinking outside the box
Research leader at Columbia University: "Visual focus on screen impairs idea-making process"
Fortha consolation: There is no harm to labor productivity or critical thinking.
A major scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of video programs on participants' creativity, compared to face-to-face sessions.
Unfortunately, it has been found that creativity is indeed compromised in virtual sessions through screens.
The research questionled by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia Universitywas whether remote computer-assisted meetings preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of distance.
The study itself began as early as 2016 but received a major boost in the two-year coronavirus, during which many employees moved to work from home.
"People in a personal meeting move around the room, use objects and use them for creative thinking," Brooks says.
"In a computer session, however, the concentration in maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of the creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which hampers the process of creating broad and expansive ideas."
Space is shrinking.
To test the results of the experiment and see if they will be repeated, they were tested twiceonce at Columbia University and once again in real lifeon engineers who knew each other from early acquaintances.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts – one being asked to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and the other being asked to do so through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to share in a similar way and solve a new problem presented to them.
In both cases, there was a decline in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, in the context of a thought activity, people often look at their surroundings in order to be assisted in creating ideas, while in the video session the thinking converges to the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.
"When the people in the same room they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can inspire new associations.
On the other hand, research shows that computer-based relationships change our attention so that we are more focused on the inside and the screen, and this way reduces innovation and idea creation through looking at the environment and thinking out."
There is no harm to critical thinking.
However, and before managers run employees back to the offices, the researchers note that "working through a computer did not harm productivity itself nor the people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea out of a set of ideas.
That is, the harm is focused on creativity only and not on the other forms of working with a computer."
Professor Alan Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also disapproves of the findings.
"There is a difference between mere creativity, like new uses for Frisbee (one of the research questions; EEG) and solutions of work.
It is also possible that when employees are more relaxed after an introduction, or they work from home, creativity will improve."
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also proposed future research in which such meetings would be discontinued for thinking situations and roaming the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Dr. Olson also suggested that, following the study, only staff brainstorming sessions be resumed and, as a rule, he suggested not to be alarmed by one study but to carry out another investigation in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forced back and not be happy is a bigger hit," he says.
Musk waits for Trump's return: 'It was wrong to block him'
Twitter's new buyer said he would reverse a decision, which led to a blockage of the former U.S. president's account.
"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter in a $44 billion deal, said Tuesday that he intended to put Trump back on the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after rioting by his supporters on Capital Hill after losing the election against Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to arrest Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake," he said.
"If there are incorrect and bad tweets, they should be deleted or rendered invisible, and suspension - a temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban," Musk said.
By 2050, the world will lose 80% of the water available to agriculture.
A new global study predicts a significant decline over the next 25 years
Solution: Proper management of water reservoirs
A recent disturbing new study published in Earth's Future predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available to agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and growth of the world's population remain in their current usage trends.
In a study involving scientists from all the world's science agencies, scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers, and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The conclusions of the grim study show that as of now the rate of water consumption has been doubling over and over the past 10 years, while at the same time global warming is causing the amount of rainfall in agricultural areas around the world to decrease.
According to the study's data, 84% of the world's agricultural land will experience a severe shortage of rainwater.
One of the key conclusions from the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and the seasons, and to switch to cultivation methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the process of water evaporation leading to widespread waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater collection technologies to prevent their flow to the sea.
Information about many students from Bar Ilan University leaked to the network
Hackers who attacked Bar Ilan University's database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about the students if they did not receive a financial ransom
The threat was realized and the information was posted across the network.
Students at Bar Ilan University are under attack from hackers when their personal information was posted across the network by a network attacker known as Darkrypt and who posted a ransom demand from university personnel a few weeks ago and threatened that if he was not paid an uncertain amount of money, he would publish the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it was an amount that began with thousands of dollars and as the clock was ticking, it rose and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are filled with angry messages and the mess is celebrated there, with students failing to access their personal information systems and unable to perform routine student assignments.
The university sent an e-mail announcing the attack had been carried out by the academic institution and that they were acting intensively to minimize the damage, while detailing some of the information leaked to the network.
No special instructions were given to those whose information had been compromised and it was said there that the university had carried out a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.
Line up for 40 settlements: The optical fiber reaches Binyamin
The trend of networking the periphery on a fast-paced Internet continues and now the optical fiber reaches the Binyamin Council which includes 40 settlements
The project in conjunction with the Council and telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Internet Rimon will be launched immediately after the holidays.
The Binyamin Council signed a wide-ranging agreement over the weekend to lay fiber optics in all council settlements.
The agreement with the Net-Fiber initiative in cooperation with Internet Rimon, Telleran and X-Fiber was signed after the conclusion of a large tender for which the council had been working in recent months.
The works will begin after the holidays and residents from 40 council settlements who would be interested in connecting to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabyte as well as advanced end-to-house equipment that will allow for strong WiFi reception, as required at these times.
The entrants will be able to choose between high-speed internet over fiber optics or online filtered fast over fiber optics which they will provide online with a grenade.
The Council has made sure that the market remains open to competition in any situation.
The head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Israel Gantz: "These are real Zionism.
It's big news for the residents.
The experience of living in Benyamin will improve, students will be able to learn remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in communities that will receive quality internet and without delays.
I want to wish success to the expensive companies in the performing tasks in the settlements.
The people are waiting for you."
Gantz added: "Soon we will have the proper conditions for faster internet than some of the best in Israel.
We have labored for many months to bring about a foundation for the installation of fiber and now the vision becomes a reality.
I thank the media minister Jooz Handel who started the project with us already in his previous term and we are now reaping the fruits of the toil, the media minister's staff, the council members who were loyal to the details of the center and the CEOs of the companies who won the center for professional quality among the best in Israel."
Internet Rimon CEO Yariv Parr: "I thank Council Chief Yisrael Gantz and his staff for immediately lifting the glove in order to bring in a line to the thousands of council residents who will switch to fast internet use that will upgrade the quality of life in the areas of education, economics and of course leisure."
Telran Communications Group CEO Shai Aslan said: "We are pleased with the Binyamin Council's decision to connect to fast and powerful Internet infrastructure and I am confident that thanks to the group's extensive experience we will be able to give residents a fast internet just like in the center of the country."
CEO of X-Fiber, Israel Elitzur: "The establishment of communication infrastructure in Binyamin is the Zionism of 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the establishment of the new infrastructure in the biblical areas of Binyamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with Judea and Samaria in general and Binyamin in particular, we will meet every engineering challenge in order to bring the high-speed Internet to every home throughout the council."
We checked: What do the side effects after the coronavirus vaccine say?
Many people who are vaccinated feel weak, warm, and tired after receiving the injection, while others feel nothing
Can it indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these phenomena, or is it a baseless rumor?
As more and more people become vaccinated, the lack of information about the side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are untrue.
Is the immune system of those who have developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies have responded less severely to the vaccine, which may prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body that enters the body?
"There are several levels of responses to the vaccine," says Dr. David Dvir, head of the Unitarian Primary Medicine Division and a member of the IDF Advisory Committee (Team for the Treatment of Pestilence), reassuring: "Headaches, fatigue, pains in place, these are the immediate responses of the immune system.
This is how the body reacts to the entry of a foreign body into the system."
Is there a link between the levels of antibodies that develop to the side effects?
"There is no correlation between the sensations and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 60%-50% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
It was not found that people who developed stronger responses were more protected."
"In medical literature, there is no correlation between an immediate response to the level of the vaccine.
In some trials where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It is also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that happen could also happen normally, but since the public has been vaccinated it attributes the response to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that is seen regarding vaccines in general – attribution of phenomena that happen near the vaccine and are attributed to it."
According to Dr. Dvir, the causes of the reported common phenomena, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions are divided.
"There are all kinds of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that this is a strong immune response."
Is it even possible to assess the strength of a immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, they showed that those who did not sleep or were under higher pressure were more susceptible to infection.
Besides, there are laboratory parameters that check the immune system or its components.
When there is a decrease in the immune system, it is immediately seen.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like anyone's walking around with a weak immune system and unaware of it.
These are people who come to clarification because of repeated events of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want a very strong immune system, because it can cause autoimmune diseases."
Soon, mRNA vaccines will appear in more contexts, thanks to the great knowledge that has accumulated about them in recent times.
"There is no doubt that Yasla opened up to other vaccines of this kind.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines – for oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance remains very little time in the body - goes in, does its operation, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it has received a serious boost due to the very great need for rapid vaccination.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between doses is too small, and some vaccine experts claim that after a third dose we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is unclear whether we are going to be in a vaccine state every six months or whether the third dose will give a greater margin."
Thousands injured: Severe privacy default on Route 6
Route 6 customers?
Your private information, including full name, addresses, payment amounts and full travel details, may have been disclosed
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz company violated the Privacy Protection Act and its regulations.
After a report by Derech Eretz, the operator of Route 6 in Israel, about a security incident that took place in the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement process.
As part of the incident, security weaknesses were discovered on its payment website, which allowed the exposure of a lot of information from the invoices of the member's customers, which were exposed to all.
Among other things, customers' invoices were exposed over a short period of time and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates, and at what hours.
Furthermore, because the Derech Eretz company did not legally document access to its systems, it is not possible to know accurately for what period of time unauthorized parties could access the company's systems.
In the breach letter, passed by the Privacy Protection Authority to the company, the Authority emphasized that most of the large companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that with the development of threats and risks, the organization is obligated to scrutinize the risks being updated and to act in accordance with the updated security measures accepted in the circumstances of the case, in accordance with the nature and nature of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations have a duty to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests, in order to examine the changing risks and prepare for them.
It is also mandatory for companies and organizations to use an automated documentation mechanism and employee training should be conducted, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection (Information Security) Regulations.
In accordance with the findings of the oversight, the Authority determined that the company had violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Act and its regulations as well as required the company to perform several corrective actions.
Route 6 operator said: "The issue has been handled in accordance with the most stringent requirements"
Travel warning to Istanbul: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change their destination or flight date
In a message to Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: The airlines will allow the flight dates to be changed.
Reminder: Earlier this week the Counterterrorism Bureau raised the severity of the travel warning to Istanbul to a level four.
This is the highest level and means "high threat level: do not arrive in this country and in the event of a stay you must leave the country as soon as possible".
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said they would allow Israelis who booked their flight before the departure of the travel warning, i.e. before the date 13.6.22, to replace their destination or flight date.
This is in an appeal to the airline.
Tourism Minister Rezbozov said: "The citizens of Israel should not pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am pleased that large airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have complied with our request and I hope that additional companies will respond similarly to all Israeli citizens who cancelled their holiday in Turkey because of the severe travel warning."

Saudi Sky Approaches: Israeli Companies Prepare to Strengthen Lines to the East
The consolidated summary for extended flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
Israel's largest airline plans significant changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we have published in Israel Today, it is estimated that Biden will announce permission for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the United Arab Emirates.
The significance of the agreement is that El Al will be able to fly shorter routes to the Far East and Australia destinations.
To do this, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to evacuate planes in favor of new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be cancelled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations where there is not a small Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable to society.
On the other hand, the new destinations looking at El Al are Tokyo, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
This is how the move will be carried out: The Dreamliner jets flying to Canada will be released in favor of long flights to the east.
The Boeing 737s that fly to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred for use to flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which EL AL operates flights using the Dreamliner aircraft.
So basically the company will be able to release large planes to fly to other destinations in the east.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to be held in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to return to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exempt from isolation for vaccinated and recovering non-red countries, foreign tourists return.
Landers in Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health that they were exempt from the obligation of isolation upon receiving a negative response to the Corona test.
It was only after that that the ministry issued an official announcement that only passengers from orange countries, although also returning from red countries reported receiving the message
In addition: tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country as well as the removal of many red destinations from the list.
At the height of an epidemic – the end of isolation for foreign returnees?
The Ministry of Health sent return announcements to Israel this morning that they were exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative response to the coronavirus test they performed after landing in Israel.
It is also used in red states.
Some of the sent messages informed the returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative reply or after 24 hours at the latest, and some received the exemption after receiving the negative answer.
It was only after that that official announcement from the Ministry of Health said that as of midnight, 4.1.2022, vaccinated or recovering, returning from orange countries will perform a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and will be quarantined for 24 hours or until a negative result (whichever comes first).
The decision will be anchored in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be brought to the approval of the Knesset Health Committee.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovering persons who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed at the entrance to Israel, will end the isolation at midnight tonight and are not obligated to perform a second test.
However, passengers from red countries reported that they too received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recuperated and returned from an orange country will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation upon receiving a negative result in a PCR test performed as of day 7 of landing in Israel (the day of landing is day 1).
The decision to remove most restrictions on the pilots and especially on the vaccinated comes a day before the High Court hearings submitted by the Association of Travel Offices, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association.
In a hearing held tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand the removal of all other red states from the list, with the person backing them in his opinion being Professor Itamar Grotto.
Foreigners can also enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transportation concluded that as of Sunday 9.1.2022, the entry of vaccinated/recovery foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from Orange countries will be permitted – subject to filling out an online form in advance, carrying out a PCR or antigen test before boarding, conducting a PCR check at the entrance to Israel and then entering isolation for 24 hours or receiving a negative response on the inspection (the earlier).
Unvaccinated/unrecovery foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, with the exception of those whose entry was approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The group plan will not be renewed at this time.
What about red states?
The Committee to Classify States in the Ministry of Health recommends that the government be removed from the list of red states and transferred to the list of orange states: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The remaining countries are currently on the list of red states: the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another possibility being examined by the Ministry of Health is to exempt from isolating the vaccinated returning from red states.
It is currently unclear whether there is a connection between the messages received this morning returning to Israel and the guidelines that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
The Ministry of Health has yet to receive a response.
The sky is starting to open: The Ministry of Health is changing restrictions on the country's gates
Immunizations returning from orange countries will be charged with 24-hour isolation
The U.S. states, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates will be defined as red.
After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which to fly without restrictions, and after all returning from abroad were charged with isolation, alongside a ban on tourists entering Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health has decided to recommend rescinding the three-day solitary confinement obligation for Israelis returning from orange countries.
So far, any inoculated or recovering according to the Ministry of Health definitions that have returned from an orange country – has been charged with solitary confinement for three days, subject to two Corona tests.
Now, the isolation that will have to be entered by the vaccinated and recovering people returning from orange countries is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of the coronavirus tests are obtained that are performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (whichever comes first).
Those who are not defined as immune or recovering will nevertheless be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two Corona tests, or 14 days without the second test, whether returning from an orange country or returning from a red country.
Immunized or recovering returning from a red state must also be fully isolated.
The list of the latest red states recommended by the Ministry of Health, and which still has to pass the approval of the government, includes the US, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the UK, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, with the exception of Turkey, the average positives that have entered the country in the past two weeks are more than 5% of the total incoming, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is rapid, the rate of positive recurrence from which stands at just over 4%, so it was decided to put it on the list of red states as well.
The most prominent countries to be removed from the list of red states: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, as of January 9, tourists who are vaccinated according to the Ministry of Health's requirements will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, and similar to the conditions of Israelis returning from an orange country.
In this case as well, the decision is subject to the approval of the government, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that few cases in which the government does not approve of the Ministry of Health's recommendations in this area.
Tourists against the restrictions.
The Travel Offices Association, the Open Sky Headquarters, and the Hotel Association filed a petition with the High Court of Justice to lift restrictions on the flyers.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but left eight significant countries on the list of red states.
In a hearing this morning in Jerusalem, petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
Those who support the petitioners' position are Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razbozov, who has supported relief in recent weeks with regard to the entry of foreign tourists into Israel, said yesterday: "The abolition of isolation for those vaccinated returning from abroad and the return of tourism to those vaccinated is the right and just thing in this period.
I thank my colleagues in government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighed the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the epidemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to conduct a enabling routine alongside the coronavirus."
With an investment of 200 million shekels: the new resort that will open near Arad
The desert is booming: another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years
Chef restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are only a small part of what the hotel will offer.
All the details in the article
The 7 MINDS company from Fattal House and the White City Real Estate Company jointly purchased a plot spanning a 20-acre dew in the Judean Desert, in which they will establish a luxurious resort at an investment of about NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same property as the Masada Hotel, which was demolished about a year ago.
The resort won't open for another three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef restaurants, a recreation area, a gym and more.
The person in charge of the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ran Shmueli of Claro Restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one to build the menu that is expected to have a desert concept unique to the resort.
The mayor of Arad, Adv. Nissan Ben Hemo, welcomed the project: "The decision to establish a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official stamp to the amazing miracle that Arad has made in the tourism field in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the entrepreneurs and am convinced that this will be a joint success since Arad has tremendous tourist potential."
EL AL announces flights to all of Europe starting at $78
The sky opens and airlines launch operations that haven't been seen in a long time.
Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Budapest, Berlin, Amsterdam and other destinations for less than $100 for round-trip flights
(Laughs)
The largest airline in Israel has reported an increase in demand for flights abroad since yesterday's announcement of the significant easement to flights.
The company decided to publish a special operation this morning for the opening of the sky and the prices it offers are considered particularly attractive.
As part of the new operation, the company offers flights to Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Athens, Amsterdam, Lisbon and other destinations at prices starting from about $60 for round-trip flights.
Following the easing of flights, EL AL is returning flights to a range of destinations including Canada, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Belgium and other countries.
It is important to remember that this is a limited number of tickets (about 4,000) and the price does not include luggage and seat selection.
The offer is valid for bookings to be made today and tomorrow and for flights to take off by January 31, 2022.
Starting at midnight tonight, France, Spain, Portugal and other countries will be removed from the list of red states.
The United States, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and five other countries are still on the list of red states and there is a ban on flying to them without the approval of an exceptions committee.
Almost every person these days has a tablet or "old" smartphone lying in a useless closet.
Just because a slightly newer and improved model came out, any device could be in place of a Spotify player in a Hotspot connection.
Old devices can be road cameras, remote control for operating devices at home and many other uses.
There doesn't have to be victims of consumer culture and there doesn't have to be always at the forefront of technology, with another truly useless gadget.
Collecting data without analysis.
Pity.
It was more interesting to hear how many people received allowances in the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the requested city centers) was worth, and how much the wages of the workers (minimum).
Israel Post must not be privatized
The question is how many packages have arrived and how many have been distributed?
For how many have disappeared to them

There should be a package tax of 5 shekels that will not be ordered for nothing but shekel nonsense and will load up on the mail.
This is mainly indicative of the cost of living in the country.
Thank you to King Pakim for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to approach the mail and hope that no letters will come from them and the hatred of the mail has led us to give up anything belonging to the possibility of mail.

Much more suitable than Wilbekin for the Maccabi that is being built.
You can see that there are professionals in Maccabi – Blatt and Ketch.
Maybe personal abilities are still as good as Scottish but a team player, and mostly a much higher game intelligence.
It is so sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis are warming the bench.
By the way Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners and therefore will not succeed with all the stars that have scratched from around the world
Who cares???
If you're already watching a game where 6 American and 3 Israeli players are decorating, wouldn't it be better to watch a Golden State game???
A puzzle until the league is over.
Good luck.
Good column.
I did.
As for the Israelis, he's absolutely right!
And a note about Ziv – we saw last season that he was a good player who could also lead a team.
So in EuroLeague he cannot be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (and it is no wonder after the treatment he received after two bad games in the EuroLeague, as if foreigners did not have such games) and his use may also be incorrect, and is the result of the coach's deficits and failures.
Blazer didn't score with all due respect...
Yiftach Ziv shouldn't be in Maccabi Tel Aviv. He's destroying it right away.
There used to be no good game but Sorkin and Blazer Doody and Cohen today well done.
Ido Ashded is a Holon fan bum who was given 500 NIS so he writes nonsense.
In the picture not Federman.
Blazer, Sorkin, and Jack Cohen are much better than Culliero and Taylor, who in Europe play about twenty minutes and are unable to score a basket, who needs outsiders on a level of nothing and nothing, much better to be played by the Israelis.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone Coaching players and management on the memontum pull
Depending on the internal wear increase...
And the disciplinary and required reinforcement of the coordinator and the guard
And that's the management part.
Not true.
The unmediated human interaction is important from many, many aspects.
The answer to this research is that social isolation is also a bad thing from the professional aspect and the truth, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the camera zoom and solve the problem.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and so their creativity was not enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone here missed an important detail.
Scientists don't care about warming or rainwater
They only care about population growth.
They're working on more and more vaccines and bastardized methods to destroy the world's population so they're telling us fuggy stories about warming and more nonsense that they're making up.
There is no problem with water desalination, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
In the meantime there are more people.
The solution is the restriction of birth, mainly in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the other anti-state leftists, and in all religions who believe in the gods - in the foolish, the ignorant, the foolish, the blind, or in short - in the herds.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living creatures (also sesmolans) consume oxygen and emit carbon report.
Solution: Sesmolans, commit suicide!
It's green.
Good for the world.
May it be better for you, and for sure the earth and all of us.
Who are the scientists and how did the research
I don't believe every study that talks about climate change because this thing doesn't exist.
He stuttered to control us to usurp our freedom and our freedom.
It's all part of the New World Order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side like he did during the Corona.
I've never heard of him presenting facts from both sides. He always brings in the side that serves the globalists.
We're being spun.
They're just burning money for academic "research" bullshit.
As usual, another engraving from the land of the Psychopathic Sesmolans.
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge is expanding and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world's population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, launched a huge project of war in the Gobi desert, with amazing success.
The Saudis do the same and succeed (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It is precisely the silly "climate crisis" of the sesmolans (carbon dioxide emissions, which are needed for plants) that causes the sedition to get greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the sesmolan agenda, so you won't read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists don't worry.
Their urine goes straight to the head and so they don't dry out.
Does proper management of water reservoirs mean cutting at least 70% of the world's population?
It is surprising that COVID comes and it is surprising that the majority of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose implications for the injection range of 5-25 years are not known at all.
It is also amazing that the 2030 Agenda is underway and now this?
I'm really curious about the whole story!!
Oh, what bullshit.
Tales of the Thousand and One Nights, all intimidation and of course left-wing nonsense that tries to control the world through control of the media, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rainfall for two years.
It was said that no more rain fell in the country and the drought is constant and there is rain.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and Peres did not know that Yemenite children were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities and Azar Weizmann did not tamper with his female soldiers.
It is clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting mumbo jumbo.
They'll also take care of the contractions, the power outages and the power outages, and we're on a roll.
"This is real Zionism" as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following rogue Bennett, the rest of the white supremacist politicians will line up in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I'm not getting anywhere near El Al, more like a "shoe on"
It was very nice to see you and not see you.
You won't see us in dreams either.
One more big shame, we in Israel are being held captive by Elal Company. All direct flights in its hands are price pigs. You'd better go bankrupt already, it's time for a truly open sky.4
Some focus on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia would allow al-Al to fly over its territory, then it would not add more to the Israeli economy than a few tens of millions, not such a large game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa via Jordan to Saudi Arabia Qatar and the Emirates, tourism allowing Israeli drinking companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
It's much more interesting than 30 planes a week that will save an hour each.
It is more important that they let the Air Force squadrons settle in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and organize the Emirate of Bahrain Oman Egypt and Morocco to drop arms on Iran non-stop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another squadron of the air force to set up in northern Saudi Arabia and beat up Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq to the east from a less crowded area.
After we are done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait Djibouti and the Comoros into a peace agreement with Israel and gain a majority of the Arab League countries that have joined the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup stabilized the oil and gas market, and Erdogan's replacement could also help Saudi Arabia topple the regime in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversion of this country, and its support for the Muslim others and Hamas.
When all these common interests are over, it will be possible to talk about a few more Elal flights if Elal survives at all by then.
El Al needs to be shut down.
Tickets are sold for flights that do not take place.
The worst is that there is no way to get a representative
"There is no customer service.
Anyone who buys a ticket at EL AL and wants to change or cancel forget about it, a sure loss.
You have been warned.
Air Canada is better.
They prefer to fly inland.
Earthing transformed from company shit into company hell.
El Al also went down in class.
Best to call a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sued on the train to the field
40 euros suitcase in Ryanair is a lot cheaper than Wiz.
An 8 kg backpack can be raised.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air on cargo and seating takes much more meaningful!!!
One Big Scramble
Just for example. I just got back. If you'll call me...
The permissible weight is 30 kg
And 7 kg trolley
And any extra 1 kg $30
Go to Update
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices but in the end it's a bag the size of a school bag.
Trolley already costs money and a suitcase costs very, very expensive.
It's a good thing the companies don't ask us to come on the plane with underwear and a tank top so there's no weight on the plane.
In El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% cost per booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, in a successful method.
A country eats its inhabitants and eats.
This has to be added to genetic parsimony.
Also a disgrace to our country that allows foreign airlines to oppress the Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does as he pleases.
So what did you learn today that it wasn't enough that you paid for an expensive ticket?
We all had a surprise.
Pay extra for the plane's wheels, windows, suitcases that don't come, food, drink, and probably add to the toilet.
Leave it at home and prices will go down.
Or great. Get out on the ships.
A journey will take a few days.
Wake up and then you'll probably come too.
Bennett wants to check how much he can attack and harm Israel, and still get to be killed and supported by his new fans.
Open now?
It's no accident.
Just when the mess starts there's an exemption, just hallucinate what's going on here...
This is not the height of the plague.
Simon, doesn't suit you.
The number of confirmed increases does not mean the number of patients increases
Stop being tested for any nonsense, sit at home if you are not feeling well.
End of story
A government of fools.
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
Especially stupid.
And public confusion score 0
Only more damage than canal
I suggest you open a new corner: "The number of deceased daily and cumulatively from the beginning of the fifth wave.
The faces and images behind the defaults."
Your ratings will be spiked.
Don't you understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourist workers?
Bringing More Paste
They don't care about the people.
8500 have died so far
Anything talk about it?
Bury us, especially the elderly
We became Russia/North Korea.
If you don't talk about it, it doesn't exist!
The main thing is for the citizens to put money into the state coffers to grow the ministers the belly and buttocks!
Apparently, Doberman and Abbas are prime minister!
Very well, delaying the Omicron was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half a people, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron - which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they are statistically less dangerous than those who are already here.
This is the first time I have seen reasonable steps by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona.
As if someone really sat down and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi – did what he thought would look better in the paper (and failed on all counts).
The government has recovered at its best:
A finance minister who tells road teachers to find a new profession two weeks ago, is fluent in opening the sky to tourists.
The Education Minister from Kishasha chirps at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and sets her own policy, which puts all schools in total chaos!
Foreign Minister, a clown who comes sick in Corona for a government meeting.
And the most clown prime minister we've ever had in the country, doesn't control the situation and is losing it like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without our leadership without direction, which all the people of Israel have lost faith in.
Go home and be beautiful one hour early!!
In my opinion, it may come from a place not good but from a place of loss of control.
Now the prices of apartments there will jump to 50 million for the apartment.
Where are all the forecasters?
They build a bus station and believe it will affect all the houses.
Apart from sponsorship after me.
Find out the prices of Arad's exorbitant arnona The hotel will return to be a white elephant like its predecessor
Looks amazing.
Lots of luck.
I feel like it.
How about art to be photographed completely naked?
Giving up the rubbish.
Pete is serious about the Berrre field.
Why don't they give benefits to girls in the Galilee occupied by the Muslim Brotherhood of the Harbant
Everybody to the pitchers.
In the present reality, is the South still ours?!
Need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
My friends will probably be there too!
What about a folk hotel for a folk person?
Well done for investments in the South [blooming]
Arad is developing and prospering and all due respect to the mayor who since the beginning of his term has had an explosion for the betterment and glory of the city of Arad
Cultural life, society, education and more about height
Just a great mayor who has improved the city!
Well done.
I wonder how much a Bedouin protection will pay the owner of the resort.
Made money for protection?
Wow, sounds good.
Those who can only afford a super-company with service and security, the best in the world.
When was the last time you could fly to Dubai???
Al's on a tin company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In the past few weeks, she has cancelled flights back from abroad, you see, sent messages to the Israelis and told them that the flight was canceled, destroyed the entire trip on the spot, informed passengers to leave a message on W.App or Messenger and we will return, returned after a day or even three.
The trip was ruined.
Besides it's better to ground planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to the country, and prevent economic damage as well?
Are there any other suckers flying Elal?
He also doesn't fly with them for free.
Have the millions of customers taken prisoner been returned yet?
EasyJet to Geneva back to back 70 euros.
Al on one-way $560.
From the cheating religious man who rules the company along with his stupid son I don't even buy for $10, non-stop cheaters...
Then the company will cancel flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization would be plus a price change.
Those who buy tickets put their money on the wing of the plane.
Tin company.
Low-Cost Exercises.
No luggage, no choice of seat, probably no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Flights Corona...
To all the members of the Goolysia... about me!
Nature thins out fools!!
