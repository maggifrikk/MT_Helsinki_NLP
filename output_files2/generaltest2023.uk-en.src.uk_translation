Children's Exploration to preschool do Children's Gardens, Prague 8, U School Garden 8 - 2022/2023 for the year 2022/23
The solution for entering preschool is to actually live an Abituren, in the case of foreigners - a place of residence, in the appropriate school district of the IRA, during the terming of preschool education in the Kindergarten Garden, Prague 8, in the High School Garden 8.
Another appreciated criteria is the child's age.
Children are adopted in stages according to the criteria below as to the ability of their kindergarten.
And if you can, pray for us, all English names in your prayers.
Because these are our names...
יהוה List from theoccupation
Kherson.
▪ Natasha, we do our best.
They feel scared.
Very scared.
They can stop any human on the street and make them repeat several times that they're big, that they're strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and we spin our heads -- how do you, S@ka, fear if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat that greatness.
How can you not be sure of yourself?
It's like a sexual act with an impotence that needs endless repetition that he's powerful, that he's got it all coming out, very long and persistent for him to try and think, but when it's painful abuse, it's finally over.
We repeat it to save us all.
Because it's very difficult to fight an unarmed man against a brainless body with a machine.
Because then, when this uncleanness is expelled from our earth, we will have to organize the city.
Whoever we're talking to right now is all on the same page.
The smell in the city is rotten.
We'll probably need a lot of cleaning facilities to just wash the sidewalks for a long time, the houses, and even the trees. Because everything these non-humans touch has a smell of decay.
Yesterday, a retired woman refused to say that they were big.
Three healthy men stripped her naked and left her outside to prevent anyone from approaching her to help her.
She stood naked for three hours on the street and said out loud,
I want you to stay away from me, my family.
Do not expose yourself to danger.
Please!
We'll still have a lot of things to do...
Then!
And more.
They're stealing.
They steal everything.
I even find it hard to think that they don't steal.
We've never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting with children's toys and ending with a box of vegetables that's been picked up.
They are afraid because their cards are constantly being made in the city.
Our cards with a Ukrainian symbol.
We're waiting for the ECU.
And when they're close, the men with bare hands and teeth will be able to work out with uncleanness.
They feel it.
So they're in a hurry.
We'll wait.
We'll wait.
Let's brush our teeth, press our fists until they're numb, and wait.
Because we have something to wait for.
For once and for all.
And none of this unclean stuff is left.
And then we'll wash the city.
Long time.
Natasha, tell everyone that Khererson is Ukraine!
And if you can, pray for us, all English names in your prayers.
Because these are our names...
The author is not given the obvious reasons for this.
Well, I need to talk to you. You know, I think there's something I've figured out, and I know there's not a lot of people who want to talk to sour people, but I still don't lose hope.
How satisfying are you?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are now being addressed to the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in a study among Ukrainians who came to Czechia because of war.
The findings will help us to get better acquainted with their situation and plan for the maximum success possible.
Data collection is done through an online agency.
Any who request humanitarian help via functional e-mail are invited to investigate (from the invitation address@click4survey. cz).
Each one is filled!
When you fill out the questionnaire, you will find it helpful to note the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
THE TECHNIC ON WORK
" THE MACHANIC ON THE WORK
We're producing electronic microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists all over the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics, or modern drugs wouldn't be without these devices from Brno.
We're looking at our manufacturing team of new colleagues who want to work in a unique environment, they don't fear technology, and they want to get stable and promising jobs.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I want to say a few words about it.
A strong desire to gather with the inhabitants to discuss important, emotional issues, but meetings are prohibited because war is a thing of the land.
I will be grateful for the right advice and for any help I can give in my desire to do as much for the people as I can.
Together we are the force.
Together, we can overcome all our problems.
Together we'll win.
So turn around.
I'll listen to everybody.
I will be glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the provision of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all Ukrainian refugees who arrive have the right to pay for their first aid to 5,000 crowns without any additional conditions (only needed for temporary protection).
To receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his own plight to be considered unemployed, to have no property in the Czech Republic, and so forth.
The Ministry decided to change this practice by saying,
1 • The first payment of aid will cease to be clear.
If a refugee is given free housing, multiple meals, and hygiene equipment every day, he will not be able to claim 5,000 crowns.
The authorities will start to think that basic aid has been provided in natural form (use, food, and hygiene), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been accomplished and there is no need to pay for money.
This action is called for the solution to the problem of Gypsy refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic simply for financial assistance.
Second, third, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, as they still have, will be granted only those refugees who will meet their immediate need (missing jobs, etc.).
However, two more conditions will be added:
▪ As in the first point, only Ukrainians who have not received free housing, multiple meals, and hygiene daily will be able to obtain monetary aid.
▸ The applicant must actually live in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to stop the practice of ʽturism for help when a refugee lives in one country and comes to Czechia only for a few days for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the ISS about a change in residence within three days of moving.
If the address in the relief questionnaire does not match the address mentioned in the I.M.S. database, the applicant will be asked to give evidence that she is actually living in Czechia.
Otherwise, relief will be denied.
The Czech Republic is currently spending 2.626 billion dollars on humanitarian aid.
And I was doing a whole day's work of digging the defenses, and the whole town was digging, and something not very happy to predict for the coming period.
To be honest, you're tired, it's very difficult to organize this process.
We're helping an army dig trenches and trenches, and that's what someone has to do with the technology and the people, and I'm the village mayor, that's my job.
Confused by all the utility companies, as well as by the farmers, they have excautors and tractors.
We've got to band together or we can't beat the kataz.
Great propaganda for people to give up and weaken their opposition
To be honest, I still haven't taken a shovel today. I hope I don't have to.
I've got kids putting stick stickers on my phone boots so I don't forget that I'm a female.
What happens if the bill is approved?
▪ A government commission from the Office of the President's Office, some Ministrys and Business Associations, will be formed to examine the public administration's instruments more quickly.
▸ Commission and other executive authorities will review all available business documents in most areas by the end of the year.
And they'll propose which of the permits or procedures should be cleared.
In accelerated mode, all יהוה not required permits and procedures will be removed.
No public discussion, in Kuluar mode!
▸ Will it matter whether Kabmin's decisions are in conflict with the right laws?
The public and the community will lose their opportunity to regulate household activities, which can be harmful to the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
❏ Business management will take place on the principle that one new permit יהוה minus two older ones will take place.
Whether it makes any sense.
What does this have to do with the environment?
▪ In coular mode, Kabmin will be able to change any documents on permits or environmental procedures.
Forests, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact estimates, and so forth!
▪ No public or parliamentary will influence the process.
We don't even know how or who's changing criminal acts until the moment we make final decisions.
And the only ones who have access to information and influence are the ones who have this business association.
The No8058 bill is a direct threat to the environment.
Stylic terms for review of permits, non-transparent procedures, the absence of any criteria for making decisions, יהוה this movement to the east, not to the EU.
So we encourage environmental organizations and initiatives to support them.
They told her: "Grabo, Russians have come to the village; grab your cat and get in the van.
But she said I was an old whore... save the kids and the girls, and I'm over there, and she's going down to the cellar, and she's washing the cucumbers, and she's cutting off the plantain, and there's a bunch of cinnamon, and there's the doors are iron bars and silver locks.
And there's someone outside the door slamming with chains.
I didn't think I'd tell my grandmother what I'd live to live.
Seventy - and - a - half - year - olds will walk again.
Go, not in the cities, for I will curse you, and you will bring us near the kaputin kaput.
The dragon's cat pops; the windows crack the glass.
Tanks run around and dry in the houses.
Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Good afternoon, go to the post office and confirm your identity with "check-in" then, in confirmation, you'll get the code, and you'll have to put it back on the internet and you'll have it ready.
There must be a bank card registered for someone who wants financial help.
I made a familiar one, too, saying it needed a key, but when it stood up, I waited for the government to tell her why it came because it had already been registered.
She also showed, in this appendix, that it needed a key, but actually it was already registered without
Help me, the application's made online on May 5th, but there's something wrong with going to the government of work or waiting for
It says you'll get the money on the card after you process your application, but says you're not confirmed, because of the banking system you're making a mistake.
Good morning, Mrs. Angelina!
I want to make my point about using 'in' for Ukraine.
The use of this term in recent decades has turned into a serious political issue.
Russia's war against Ukraine was being prepared for a long and meaningful time, including information and linguistic policy
Thanks for interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear explanation of grammar, for pleasant communication.
Thank you especially for your technical training, primarily for a textbook that has allowed you to understand things that you sometimes haven't learned in lectures.
Those three months laid the foundation for our knowledge.
We hope that our next class will be even more productive!
Why, the creative community wants creative inspiration, peace, and happiness!
In its productions it popularizes the world's classic in Ukrainian, among which are ʽLolita (W. Nabokov), יהוה Parfumer (P.Züskind), ʽGrych (M. Co. Co. Koybinski), a stranger (C. Zweig), and so on (and T.
The creatures that he specializes in are hard to perceive, need to be implanted in the soul and the heart.
The author deliberately brings his audience to deep emotions and tears.
He found tears to be a cleansing, a way to recover a modern man.
He's got a whole range of awards.
In 2005, he received the title "The National Artist of Ukraine," Laureat of the National Prize for Ukraine by Taras Shevchenko (2007), but Mr.
As Michael's talents are appreciated, they hope that as the war ends, they will hear him play the saxophone again, see his superior skill in reincarnation, and be able to overcome their fear and pain with gratitude for high art.
Useful Fossils of Ukraine
From birth, useful fossil fuels are divided into Mammatics, Ostaus, and Metamorphics.
Thus, their location is closely related to the composition of the earth's crust.
Fiery fossil fuels in Ukraine
The fossil fuels that are mined in our country include kampane and brown coal, oil, natural gas, peas, burning spruce.
Ukraine is rich in individual fuel resources.
The state fully provides for its own needs in the stone-like and brown coal.
Ukraine, on the other hand, feels an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that as long as we don't have a rational economy, an acute shortage can occur in anything.
Torf in Ukraine has long been mined in Polyssy.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, agriculture, glass factories, porcelain, food industry.
Various chemicals, including acetone, phenols, paraffins, food, yeast, and yeast, are also extracted from peas.
In the Cherkas region and the region of Kyravogradsk, you can find plenty of fuel.
The geographic location of fuel resources is associated with tectonic and geological construction.
The burning resources have sedimentary origins, so they are included in the boat's ancient and young platforms as well as in the extreme foothills of the foothills.
Camaοne Coal.
94.3% of our nation's coal deposits are coal.
Ukrainian coal is noted for its high quality.
At the high levels of carbon, it has a high heating capacity.
In Ukraine, there's the best type of coal, and the amount of carbon is going to be at 94 to 97 percent.
One-third of coal is cocaine.
After special processing, it is used to melt iron and steel.
Ukraine has the eighth place in the world and the second place in Europe, and XI is the mined area and the third place in Europe.
The coal reserves in Ukraine are about 50 billion tons.
Prognosticated supplies are about 120 billion tons.
The Russians like to write a report on the projectiles that drop on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
So, the Ukrainian band of Kalush Orchestraa called from the scene of Eurovist saving the military locked at  Ohovstall, in Mariopolis, and the next day, the Russians wrote on the projectiles ʽKalush like you asked! # For Azstal.
On the rockets that the Russian military, on April 8, 2022, shot the station in Kramatorsk, it said, "For the children. "
Then, 61 people died of cynical shells, including 7 children.
The tradition of writing on projectiles came to light in World War I.
In the second world power, the Soviets also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
At that time, soldiers were helped to maintain their fighting spirit while protecting their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on the projectiles are Russian military, יהוה cynical, and cruelly gestured by the agent army.
These missiles kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine only because they don't like the country's political course.
Russia needs to be stopped before such notices can be brought to any other country!
We were met by Vyšné Nemecké, a relatively short line and friendly Slovak borderors.
Let's take insulin, it needs temperature.
Can I get control in accelerated mode?
The border guard allowed us to start the line, even the furas kindly gave up our seats.
L'viv
The city of Lion lives.
It's like the aorta of the Ukrainian body... an endless flow of people.
People from all over the country have found refuge and security.
Someone's going to Europe, someone's coming home, someone's staying.
At first glance, war immediately appears to be on the stanzas of the city.
The war is reflected in the dictated windows of the cathedrals.
It surrounds monuments and sculptures with white paintings.
But war is not heard in the Market Square, where there are thousands of voices at the same time, not heard in the coffeehouses and bars where people continue to live.
Yeah, life's been dead before?........, hiding from curfew.
But it is: when we sat in the cafe at 9 p.m. and announced alarm, it was only a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was choked by the voices of people who live their lives.
Bocher, Irren
We made our way to Kiev through two of the many Muslim cities of Buchch and Irrev.
A hero town with a smell of hope.
People return and rebuild life in spite of their pain.
A private house.
The fence is like a lattice.
(Empty shells or automatic queues?...)
On a smashed balcony, the Ukrainian flag is stretched out.
At the front door... holes such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And at this front door, three will fight.
They clean, mend, build a wall, and have a new life with it.
And the park is two blocks below, and my mother goes out with the baby.
I can't help asking: "Did their father survive the shooting of men in Bush?
Will he go out with them again?
On the exit from Irrena, a cemetery of cars
These were the very cars that the civilians were trying to get out of the car that were brutally shot by the Russian invaders.
This cemetery has already become an object of some sort of patriotism tourism.
If you go deeper and stand in the midst of a motor vehicle, you can sense a strong smell.
That must be one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow air feels like you can cut it with a knife.
And it's been weeks since the deaths of the passengers...
If you look through the holes in the car's hulls, you can see hundreds more.
And in one of the cars that we have left the bicycle, on the other side, there's a warm baby clover.
There's a book that's about burned out with a safety briefing.
The remains of someone's everyday stories and of someone's lives.
As we move on, I look back for the last time and I see the same city under which the terrified civilians hid.
This is the same bus that's rolled over, and it's right over these broken plates, the Ukrainian military nose of the baby in the white.
The child in the white barn must have survived.
But is there any chance that a child who wears clothes left in one of the cars lives?
There's a man sitting on a ragged bridge, a camera over his shoulder.
Just sitting there looking at the gap between Kiev and Buccia.
He's not taking pictures, he's just looking.
Perhaps he also imagines standing under a bridge and thinking, " How is that? '
יהוה With a festival, a happy man calls out to us.
On May 29, Kiev celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Nikolai
It's a hero city, a Marine in Ukraine, and my hometown.
A footing town that can't capture the invaders in any way.
And they believe that they will not capture the city and fight and live.
On the street corner, each second intersection has neatly folded tires and gangster lanes.
Today, the Santa Claus of the evening is remarkably quiet, and the background of the city is still dry.
No voices, no cars at night.
And at night it's extremely dark.
Lights for safety.
People live in the candles.....in the light of cell phones.
At home, we turn on the light only in the kitchen יהוה quickly and when necessary.
My grandmother hung the windows with heavy blankets, which the lights would not break through.
At my sister's baby bed, there is a hunting rifle.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause)
With air anxiety and explosions, we hide in the garage or descend to the basement.
But not every time.
Living in a state of constant anxiety can be a real challenge, even in a privable city.
When, then, should we live?
The Russian army, some 20 miles [30 km] from the city, the shots from  Ohpion, fly to the Yellow House, and close to Kulbakin.
Several times it comes close to my family.
On the next block, across the road from us.
My grandmother's neighbors moved their windows, and the children took them to their home, to a safer area.
And we're on the edge of Ingula and the central region.
Life goes on.
There's a siren on the central Council Street, and an elderly couple sitting on the bench, talking about something, talking about it calmly.
They've got a biker passing through.
So let's see what we're going to do with Dad.
Let's pop some coffee, shall we?
So let us sit on the streets of the Cathedral (formerly Soviet, by the way) in a window near Santa Claus's monument.
What else can you do?
To be honest, when a siren surprises you on the street, there is often no hiding place, no shelter, no shelter, or no basements nearby.
I'm looking at the district administration building, actually, through it.
It's not just a hole in the building, it's a hole in the heart of every artist.
The lawn near the entrance has once been decorated with the ODA.
Today, at the place where the trident was setting, there is nothing left to do.
As in the case of the Head of ODA and a dozen cabinets around.
The rocket landed clearly on Kim's desk.
The war takes on a completely different shape when it's not in the news but under the feet.
I go through the corridors of ODA, and I hear glass cartilage with every step.
There were a number of documents on the floor that were scattered around the floor that had been asked and applied, but now it doesn't matter.
On the table of one of the survivor's offices is a dusty makeup.
The flower is on the dresser.
They take her home, they transplant her, let her live.
A guard shot at the post on March 29th.
He survived.
▸ Stirred, sewed, יהוה pointed to the head. יהוה Already at work
Only journalists can get into ODA.
We have a couple journalists from Italy and BBC with us.
Photo, direct include, interviewing.
According to official estimates, the death toll is 36.
This is September 11th, in mykolaviana,.....a monument to the Russian degree, commenting on the district head press.
The Nicholas District Administration is just one of the wounds on Santa Claus's body.
And the wounds will heal quickly.
Even when Denmark is helped to restore ADA, the villagers will always see a terrible void in it.
Russia has launched a new war.
This time, against Europe, which is supporting Ukraine in the Russian war.
The RP has reduced more than a third of the gas transport to the EU since the beginning of the war.
In April the gas supply stopped completely in Bulgaria and Poland, in May, to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced the supply of gas to European countries by means of a gas - gas gas gas supply,  Oh, the North River.
Official Berlin expects Russia to cross the supply of natural gas this way by July.
This blackmail was also used in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Hydnay Revolution, when Ukraine finally chose the European course of development, RF for two days turned the country's gas supply off.
Gas has always been not just a commodity to Russia but a element of political pressure.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic relationships.
To her, the prime goal is to re-create the Soviet Union and punish the West.
The financing of the RF economy is the donats of the third world war.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already speeding up the transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to diversify the supply of gas and oil quickly.
But it takes time to become more energy dependent on Russian energy.
Meanwhile, the country's regime intimidates Europe with irreversible energy crises and the absence of heat in the homes.
Europe's countries, especially dependent on supplies of fuel from Russia, may feel its deficit.
But this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude toward natural resources and increase energy efficiency.
Europe will win when Russian energy is denied.
Because then Putin won't be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
The temporary discomfort is worth surviving so that succeeding generations of Europeans do not have to die in the new war with Russia.
Russia is burning crops in Ukrainian fields.
The RF army uses fireballs to destroy the ripe crops of grain crops and oil crops.
This Russia is the cause of the world's famine.
Because of Russia's war, the number of people in the world with food shortages can increase by more than 40 million.
At the same time, with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, the Russians steal seeds from Ukrainian elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, and block naval exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agricultural potential is another manifestation of war aggression by RF.
So Russia wants to further undermine Ukraine's economy and increase the pressure on the world.
We need more sanctions against Russia so she can't keep killing people and blackmailing the world!
Minciphers launch an innovative hotline format to the virtual center of Action.
Disfellowshipping is often forced from Ukraine in European countries by a lack of information on the rules and procedures for the development of their own stay, business registration, employment, and relief work.
So the virtual Center Action is launched to provide all the answers in the remote format until the Ukrainians can return home.
Fearful of fear every important day, and as never before, neither the day nor the moment that may come
Good morning, Anna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician back and ask when you can get another vaccine for Darus?
We were supposed to be tomorrow, I can't come because we need to replace the battery in the car, it'll be at the end of the week.
The neighbor brought a cable and we loaded it from Marina's car.
But in the machine panel, the battery needs to be replaced.
My husband bought a battery and, on Wednesday, Anastacia has to bring it from Ukraine, and I'm going to be replaced here.
I'll try to get a car tomorrow, if I work, we'll go alone, I'll leave Grandma in the car and I won't shut down the engine.
If I don't, I'll write to you and you'll come for us.
It's very uncomfortable for me to bother you, to be distracted from my job.
All right, we'll go to 11:45 with you so we don't risk it.
"The war is not over, and the fate of our new neighbors is also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of fleeing to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventures they're going on together to put them in a hurry loaded cars.
The stories of children who feel insecure and fearful of all adults who still do not fully understand why their parents stayed home.
Children's stories, for which the only memory of a house is a toy that they could practice during many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicable people, " point out the organizers.
At the end of each trip, we return to a safe home.
But this is another trip that's worse.
This trip did not end even more than eight months later.
It's supposed to be coming home.
The subject of war is everywhere, so our move may seem unnecessary.
On the contrary, we want to point out that the involuntary travelers are still among us in the midst of a society that is inflammable and exploited.
We want to give them an opportunity to tell their story in poetic form and thus to apply for participation in this celebration of the Czech Civil Society.
Now they're part of it.
Despite such a painful subject, the parade was able to make a light - and - hope parade.
This was done by craftsmen and artisans who, along with children and adults, created the suit and mask of huge toys, sunflowers, bridges, buildings, and amazing birds that shine.
Parade went from Camp to Vaclavak, but at each stop, there was a huge performity, a drama developed by Ukrainian dramatists and writer Oksana Maxia.
" It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of parade and at the same time show what I'm dealing with, Ukrainians now, " says the drama.
The first to escape are the glowing birds - they lock their wings first, the children.
And after a recent massive missile attack, this symbol of the wings protecting it becomes even more acting.
Children's voices are starting to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song moves around in a column.
And all creatures came back to life: sunflowers, umbrellas, toys, even homes.
That's symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and to all Czechs who have helped and helped Ukraine and Ukraine.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path, and security will prevail in the home.
The wife sends her husband to the market for skin cosmetic care.
On the way, he meets his friends and gets into custody for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he mentions snails, goes to the market, buy snails, and comes home.
He thinks to tell his wife why he's been gone for so long.
Calls the door, spits out the snails on the floor, the wife opens, and he pulls them up with her hands, and says,
Oh, come on!
Come in, come in, come in...
Our editorial was contacted by a Ukrainian refugee, Marina, who in her native Nicopolis worked in the construction and construction industry.
I'm trying to implement this as an artist, and I've told the Ukrainian woman.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, anxiety for family members.
In conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, there is a confusion about adapting to the new circumstances in which she and her children found themselves.
But she believes in her own strength and tries to adjust to life in Prague without giving up the thought of returning to Ukraine.
From Nicopol to Prague
Marina came from Nicopol, the Dnipropeland.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two young children.
I worked as an architect at the National Nicopolic Institute.
I am an architect of buildings and buildings, and I graduated from the Dnipropetrov Academy with a red diploma.
I've gone to art school before, I've graduated from high school, I've graduated from high school, I've graduated from high school, I've got to do it by special skill, and I've told Marina.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians who were fleeing Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina did not contemplate leaving Ukraine with the children.
Prague became a refuge for the woman.
And of course, the new city, the big, crowded... the new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so much of what Czechs say to me, I understand.
Learning English and sign language also helped me.
Moreover, I am not ashamed to turn to the Czechs for help, nor have I experienced any aggression from them.
Thanks to them for this, she shared Marina.
She said that when it came to finding housing, using visas, and insurance, receiving benefits, she was helped by people who had long lived in Prague.
But many of her problems have to be solved on her own.
No Place in the Garden
After receiving a visa for a tolerated stay, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
I want to find a job by trade, of course.
But when my employers find out that I have two children, they raise my hands.....and she told me.
We were never picked up before, since there is no room.
It is said that we should look for adaptation groups for children, and where they are, no one knows for sure.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She wanted to help me find a place in the children's garden by calling a number of different stations, but...
□ In general, I am deeply concerned about the condition of my children, the difficulty of adjusting to new circumstances, and the tendency to be capricious and rebellious.
I can't tell you that the kids are bothering me, but if they went to the garden, I could easily attend Czech classes.
I went to a Czech school once, played a little, and then became restless.
As a normal mom, I was distracted, I couldn't learn normally... if there were language courses for adults with children or if there were young people at school... but my daughter was so attached to me, &gt;&gt; she sighs. &gt;&gt;:
And of course, we're going to do all sorts of free measures with our kids, which are for refugees from Ukraine, and we're going to have a large amount of thanks to the Czech Republic, and we're going to add Marina.
When the children are asleep, Marina is self - educated, learning Czech, knowing that this will help her to find work and to organize herself in a foreign country.
To support Ukraine
One day, Marina looked through the vacancies on the Internet and saw an announcement: יהוה As part of the arrangement of the Association יהוהSpolek Zeedno, with support of the EC representation in Czechia,  liked12 stars for Ukraine, we organized a one - day art workshop in the House of National Minors in Prague.
We're looking for Ukrainian artists, offering brushes, paint.
Participants are required only to have a creative imagination.
Marina could not have missed this opportunity.
▸ I mustered up courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we painted all day.
Before, I wasn't asleep, I was worried.
In addition, for six years I had not taken my brush into my hands, יהוה she told the Ukrainian woman.
During a creative reunion 14 large - scale acrylic paintings were created on canvas about 80 x 60cm, including 12 יהוה paintings by Ukrainian artists.
And the context of the painting was free, but we agreed that we would use the English theme in our work, and that based on the palette, we would choose the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
So in the collection of paintings, you have blue yellow colors, and you have Marina added.
There were 30 applicants in the event, from which only 12 have been chosen.
Marina was among them.
On June 1st, the European Union, the Czech Republic, will be host to an exhibition in Prague to support its participation in painting.
That's how life is.
All your knowledge and skills that you once acquired can be very useful, and they can support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in Czechia,  Andrína remarked.
I'm now trying to implement myself as an artist.
Each step is a battle against its fears and itself.
But we have to do something.
Marina owes her hospitality and friendliness to the Czech Republic but believes that the war will soon end, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a lot of time to recover completely from the full-scale war that Russia started.
However, instead of looking forward to better times, the Ukrainians began to clear their cities and villages of Russian garbage by rebuilding infrastructure.
The country was hit in the early days of full - scale war when Russian invaders wanted to break into and seize the capital in a few days.
These cities and villages have survived the active fighting, the atrocities of the Russian army, some of which are known as occupations.
By the beginning of April, the SS had completely freed the region from its enemy.
A photograph by Alexander, from Kiev and the region, was taken immediately after active combat, and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public spaces.

Any response from Ukrainian military countries is valid.
After Ukraine's rapid capture plan failed, Russia began a new phase of the war יהוה information.
RF is trying to force the world to change its view of Russian war and lower Ukraine's support from the international community.
International organizations value the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the ECU fight the aggression, and thus they become partners in Russian information war.
For example, a well - known law - enforcement organization reported that the Ukrainian military is setting up a position on civilian infrastructure areas.
It ignored the fact that it was only about objects from which the peaceful population was fully evacuated.
Do not succumb to information attacks by RF!
Remember: Russia has invaded Ukraine, captures its territory, kills and tortures peaceful populations, destroys cities and villages.
RF is to blame for the war; it has no right to do anything in another country's territory.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and slaughter an enemy from occupied territories.
Help Ukraine stand up against Russia on all fronts!
I'm sure every man in the world has ever dreamed of his perfect house.
Believe me or not, I'm no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My perfect house would be on an island in the tropics.

In my perfect house, there will be at least six rooms: a light and a bridge of kitchen, a large bathtub, two cozy bedrooms, a office with a workplace and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with drawers and drawers.
There'll be a lot of interesting books in the bookcases in the office.
The living room would be the most visited place in the house, where the whole family could get together, share the news, or just have fun.
That is why there would be a large sofa with small pillows, a few chairs, a chest of drawers, a huge TV set, and a long, built - in aquarium.
In addition, my perfect house would have a mansard, where we could make a home movie theater or an entertainment room.
There'd be a swimming pool behind my house with a few erasers.
We'll also have a sports center where we can exercise every day to maintain our uniform or just to engage in various teams, such as volleyball, basketball, football, and so forth.
My ideal house would be big and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I'd love to live in it.
But it's just my dream I have to make it come alive.
Hey, how many men should I be here to make sure I know which room to cook?

Yeah, of course, and I'm asking how many of them to know where to put them.
Okay, you tell me right away what I'd know.
To Clean the Room in Time

They only let me go for 10 days with my family.
I couldn't buy everything for the baby.

So they have to know I hope they don't get panicky right now because now I don't know what to do and look for myself but I won't be allowed to go to Donetsk there's a hard fight and I don't know what it's gonna be like looking for it's hard.
So the last words I've heard from him that I'm a hard worker and that I've taken the sisters and the brothers that they're in trouble.
I have to hold on to my kids. They're holding me. They're holding my hope. And I have nothing but them. They're all I'm happy that I have them.
I don't feel good at all, but I haven't had anything like this with me.
So thanks I can't go there any other time today I need to calm down and get my thoughts together a lot.
A fight in equal syllables.
How in Turkey soccer teams from Ukraine and Russia were beaten

Photo caption,
The Maina FK says this is a fresh photo of the latest training from after a fight with the Russians.
In Turkish Antalya, there was a conflict between players of the Ukrainian football club Maina from the prime religion and the Russian Shinhwa.
The sides confirmed that it was about fighting in a local hotel area where both teams had accidentally settled.
At first, English and Russian media wrote about a conflict that took place on February 13.
Then the fighting was confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official U.K. World War II statement, the Russians provoked conflict.
As if one of them was timid and clinged to the hotel staff, the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight really took place, but it's already on the floor where the Russians are staying, and in equal syllables.
The number of victims on the Shinhwaian side only confirms the fact that the Russians are still their own, and how they are abandoned, is the statement.
The club claims that after the fighting ended, the Russians continued to fight among themselves, and the local police had to intervene.
"Before the meeting started, the main requirement for the May Day Foundation was the absence of a hotel of Russian teams.
And the organizers themselves claim that it was "Sinker" who agreed to the hotel" -- it's a statement.
A soccer journalist, Roman Bebech, who was one of the first to Twitter the situation, put up a photo of a Ukrainian player who defended a fellow worker.
The Russian side confirms that the fight was fought but that it provoked conflict in Ukraine.
In particular, Baza's telegram says that the Mayna representatives approached the players of the Jaroslav Shinhwa and demanded that they sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians denied it.
"The golden advantage was on their side.
A few people attacked our guy.
The Jaroslavs stood up for him and stood up for him.
We had five or six people, Ukrainians a lot more -- told the Russian club the source of the Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"The doctor examined the Jaroslav football players, among the injuries-- lip dispersion, foot fracture and ribs suspicion," writes "Commersant."
"I don't understand where the Ukrainians could come from, because when we booked a hotel, there was a condition that there wouldn't be any teams from Ukraine," complained St.
Kulakov then told the Russian news agency that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but he pointed out that they were not being displaced, and they decided to leave.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian are getting thin.
And there's a cure for diabetics.
7 minutes ago
Popular injections can reduce up to 15 percent of their weight, but they have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell injections for the weight loss of Wegovy, used by some well-known people, including Elon Musk.
The main component of the Wegovy is the semothide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
It was reported by Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience in social networks.
The company is also popular with well - known bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Embalming and other means of treating second - type diabetes can actually contribute to weight loss.
Depending on specific receptors in the body, they suppress the appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, people are less likely to experience hunger, get satisfied, and eat less calories.
However, experts warn that it's not a quick solution and it's not a miracle medicine to help lose weight without any effort.
The treatment takes place under the supervision of a specialist and is strengthened by diet and exercise.
Like any medicine, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea, stomach disorder, stomach loss, and gas.
In addition, rapid loss of weight can lead to loss of fat on the face, while in some people it can lead to the falling of the cheeks and the onset of a new wrinkle.
This effect was called the Oszepi face, from the name of another drug for treating diabetes, which is also used for weight loss.
Medical authorities recommend that wegovy be accepted for no more than two years.

The EU will strengthen its sanctions on RF to the DW - 08.02.2023 invasion anniversary
The European Union will launch new RF sanctions on Russia's full - scale military invasion into Ukraine.
The German chancellor Olaf Scholz (Olaf Scholz), spoke on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in Bundesta on the eve of the EU's extraordinary summit.
Shotz promised that the EU would support Ukraine "as long as necessary."
He noted that Germany is one of the countries that provides the largest financial support to Kiev.
"In arms supply and ammunition we are far ahead of everyone in continental Europe," he added.
At the same time, Shotz criticized "public trades under motto: war tanks, submarines, airplanes -- who will demand even more."
He said that only the Russian president and his propaganda would win from such debates and discrepancies.
And also, you know, Shotz: Putin made Nato an excuse for a long-delayed R.F.
NATO doesn't have to be one side of the conflict.
In addition, the German chancellor once again emphasized that despite all the help given to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not be one of the parties to the conflict with Russia.
He also promised that he would continue to coordinate closely with his arms partners.
Shalz reminded Ukraine of the promise he made at the EU's summit in June 2022 about supporting European integration.
In the future, the EU's extraordinary summit plans to confirm its commitment to Ukraine's European path, he stressed.
Ukraine belongs to Europe and its future to the European Union, and then to the Chancellor.

Russia began a major attack on Lugancia - ISW - DW - 09,02,2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Lugan region, they believe at the U.S. Institute for War IW.
Russian operations along the Svatov-Cremin line in the western region have greatly increased in the last week, as reported by the February 8 analysts.
It also notes that the project's geolocations confirmed Russian progress in the region's two - year - old northwest of Svatov.
The ECU does not ensure significant success in RF
Experts believe that the involvement of at least three major Russian divisions into major operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive began even if the Ukrainian forces do not yet permit the Russian forces to achieve significant success.
In IW, it was assumed that the RF attack had not yet reached its full pace, that Russian command had not yet taken effect in part of the 2nd Moto-man Division. (1-Pursy Tank Army, West Military County), which was moved to Lugan area in January after the expansion in Belarus.
"Although Russia's forces in the Lugan region now have an initiative (in the sense that the Russian powers set up the terms of battle by ending the Ukrainian initiative on August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final climax on the svatow-Cremin line without reaching the goal of capture of the whole Luganic and the Donnes region," is the report.
The analysts predict that this culmination might create a window of opportunity for the Ukrainian forces that they can use for their own counterpoint.
At the same time, Henschel reported on in the morning that RF troops were trying to take full control of Donetsk and Lugansk region of Ukraine, and they were still focusing their major efforts on five ways: the Cuban, Lemanese, Bahmutian, Austria, and Novoliv, in areas of Kremina, Bahmut, Austria, Océra, Marquene, and Wugder.

SpaceX limited the ability of the OCC to control drones via Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
President Mikhail Podak's adviser to the Office of the Office of Ukraine Thursday, February 9, urged the U.S. SpaceX to determine if it supported the Kiev in the war that Russia did.
He thus responded to information that Elon Musk limited the ability of Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite system.
"The commissions have to decide whether they're on the side of free life and Ukraine -- and then they're not going to do anything wrong; or they're on the RF side and its "right" to kill, to capture territories," wrote the Twitter Pole.

Starlink does not have to be a weapon
Previously, the main operating director of SpaceX Gwinn Shawwell stated that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army actively uses in opposition to Russian aggression, "was never meant to use weapons."
"The Ukrainians use it in an unpredictable way, that is no part of any agreement.
We know that the military is using it for communication, and that's normal.
But we never wanted them to use it for the next purpose," quotes the director of the Reuters agency.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink with Ukraine's arms to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could "limit their ability to do so."
"There's something we can do, and we've already done," she added.
Just what the company had done, she refused to clarify it.
SpaceX trading from U.S. Minerage for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion into Ukraine, SpaceX gave the Starlink system free of charge to the Internet.
But in September SpaceX, the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) told the Department of Defense that he could no longer continue to finance Starlink in Ukraine and ask to take over the matter.
Then she estimated the needed financing by the end of 2022, at 120 million dollars, and over the next 12 months, at about $400 million.
The financing issue was addressed at a political level both in Ukraine and in the European Union, but soon the owner of the Musque company declared that SpaceX had turned its request to the American Defense Department to requisition.
In December 2022 Ukraine arranged for SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

With Germany, relations develop undaunted - DW - 09,02,2023
The president of Ukraine, Vladimir Green, believes that the relationship between Berlin and Kiev against Russian aggression is developing in a way that is diluted -- they have lifts and downs.
This is the attitude he expressed in an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
"By nature I am a fast man.
Others act slower, which may also be associated with their bureaucracy," said Greenski, adding that under war Ukraine does not have weeks or months, but by developing every moment, life depends on people's lives.
POP Satisfaction
The president of Ukraine noted that at some point Germany's "conservative attitude " had changed and received support from Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally received support from Steinmaier (President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (Frank-Walter Steinmeier)--Red, with whom I had previously had difficulty, especially because of the so-called 'Synmaier' form," said Green.
He stressed that there was a "good work" that allowed for a change in relationships.
"We received anti-air defense systems IIS-T for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved a lot of lives," said the president of Ukraine.
Green, Berlin, estimates, has been able to increase the rate of production of these systems.
Germany had promised to give Ukraine three other IRIS-T complexes in 2023.

At the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kiev "as long as necessary."
He did the appropriate statements after meeting with the French Green and President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the leaders of the European Union on Thursday.

This was followed by consultations with the president of Maya Sandu, who informed Gavrilo on Friday, February 10.

We've come to power in the crisis government, and we've been running development policies, anti-corruption and integration in the European Union, " she declared.

"They thought we would surrender and act like previous governments who betrayed national interests, but it wasn't, and we worked in a state of continuous crisis," stressed Gavrilo.
The reasons for her decision to quit were not clarified, referring only to the lack of support and trust at home.
Sandu thanked the Premier "for the Great Sacrifice and Effort" and noted that Gavrilo led the government during the crisis.
"In the face of unprecedented challenges, the country was governed with responsible attention and commitment.

Cyprus hosts a decisive tour of the presidential elections - DW - 12.02,2023
In the Republic of Cyprus, on Sunday, February 12, there is a second, decisive tour of the presidential elections.
He became an official of the foreign affairs of Nikos Christopheris and a former permanent representative of Cyprus at the UN's Andreas Mauroynis.
The conservative politician of Christodulysis, at the end of the first tour, received 32 percent of the votes, his opponent in the second tour of Mauroni, supported by the left, won 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling party, the Democratic Union (DISY) Averof Neophyte.
The DISY Party, after losing its candidate on the first tour, was unable to determine who to support, which made the results of the crucial vote even more unpredictable, says the AFP agency.
The president of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been in the European Union since 2004, is elected by a common vote.
He's forming and directing the government of the country.
The winner of today's elections will be the head of the state for five years and become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two sections in 1974 as a result of a journey supported by the Greek junta and further intervention by the Turkish army.
In 1983, occupied by the northern part of the island, the Turks declared themselves to be the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Ankara.
The latest negotiations for Cyprus's reunification failed in 2017.
In the election, only the Quiriot Greeks are participating -- about 560,000 people.
The people of the unidentified Northern Cyprus Republic of Turkey do not vote on them.

"Energoat" reported a new threat to the EU -- DW -- 12.02.2023.
President NaEC "Energoat," Peter Cotin described the fall of Russian water in the Kahhov reservoir as a new threat to the Cold Atomic Power Plant (ZEZ).
"Very many threats to the ECU.
"The drop in water in the Cahokia reservoir is a new addition to the threat," said Cotin during a briefing on one of the AES on Sunday, February 12.
He pointed out that by the evening of February 11, the reservoirs were 13.7 feet [13.8 m] normal at 16 meters, "that the station might be fed for its generators, for the capacitors of the Turks and for the security systems."
"In the last days, we see the level stabilizes and rises a little bit, because it's going to be 13.7 m, 13.7 m," says Kotina "Interfax-inland."
He explained that the Russians, who control the airlocks at Kahhovov's GES, began to dump less water while the tide rose at the top of the Dnieper.
The President of 'Energoato' has pointed out that under these conditions, the guerilla pond on the EEC is quite full and there's still enough water, but if you lower the reservoir to a critical point, that's, he says, 'will be a big problem for the EEC.'
Cotin stressed that the temperature would be 40 feet [12 m] critical, ten feet [12.8 m] high, and he expected an international community to support the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The head of the ISS of Greece visited Turkey - DW - 12,02,203
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria led to careful diplomatic closeness between Turkey and Greece - long - standing opponents, writes on Sunday, February 12, dpa.
On that same day, the heads of the IUC two nations, Nicos Dendias and Mevluth Chavushot, held an unexpected meeting, where cameras of Greek television were filmed and even embraced.
Greece One of the First Aids to Ankarí
Chavushut thanked Dendias for Greece's becoming one of the first countries to assist Turkey immediately after a natural disaster.
He added that both nations would try to start the dialogue again and solve their problems.
"The help of Greece to the Turkish people doesn't end there," emphasized the head of the Greek ISS.
According to him, Athens is "to do everything" at a two-way level, and also within the EU, to help Turkey.
Dendis became the EU's first minister of foreign affairs to visit the disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams work in the Antakya and Hatai region.
New beginnings in two-way relationships?
Political reviewers and colporteurs in the Greek press have for several days expressed the hope that help given to Athena Ankari could be a new start in the relationship between two countries.
Both NaTO members showed solidarity during the great earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This help, known as the earthquake Diplomatia, helped achieve a specific discharge.
Conflict Through Islands
Athens and Ankara have fought for decades for sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
Ankar challenges Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern part of the Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos, and Kos.
Greece kind of breaks international agreements, keeping military presence there.
Athens Justifies the position of troops on the islands with the threat of numerous desert ships on Turkish western coast and the right of every nation on self - defense.
See also: Greece and Turkey on the brink of armed conflict?
Turkey daily reinforces its claims by flying fighters over Greek islands.
In recent months, the leader of the country of Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Ankara's Warming With Armenia
In the face of a tragedy caused by earthquakes, there is also a warming of Turkey's relations with Armenia.
Ankara has opened up over 30 years of transition through relief trucks from Armenia to affected survivors.
Armenia also reported the shipment of two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after an earthquake on February 6, killing over 33 thousand people.
The relationship between Ankara and Yerevan was tense for historical reasons - some 1.5 million Armenians were the victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As viceroy of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits that she murdered several hundred thousand Armenians but refuses to define it as genocide.
At the same time, Armenian genocide was condemned, especially in the United States, Germany, and France.
The Sumpau border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
In the face of a conflict in the Sermon on the Mount, and in support of Turkey, Azerbaijan, things were getting harder.

further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02,2023
In Brussels a two-day session of defense ministers of the Nato countries began, which hosts a meeting on Tuesday, February 14, in the so-called "Ramstein" format.
In the agenda of the day, further growth of support for Ukraine in the war and increased fighting rates.
The secretary - general of Nato Yens Stoltenberg announced to the court that NATO should secure Ukraine's weapons "to win this war."
"We don't see any sign that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he's preparing for a new war, new offensives and new attacks," quotes his Reuters.
"It's a war to burn out, and therefore a logistic battle," added Stoltenberg, alluding to Ukraine's need for more weapons and to negotiate possible delivery of combat planes to Ukraine.
The chapter of the Munich Conference is against red lines in helping Ukraine.
During the meeting, ministers are expected to approve long - term methodical recommendations to defend the alliance.
"The partners will discuss investment in defense, and how to protect our critical infrastructure," quote St. Stötenberg's Interfax Ukraine.
What to Expect of the Nine "Ramstein"
That same day, NaTO headquarters in Brussels has a U.S. Contact Group to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, which is taking part in Ukraine's Secretary of Defense Alexei Reznikov.
The head of Ukraine's defense will also join the special session of the Navy Secretary's Court of Defense.
"Over 50 member countries, the Contact Group is the only one with you in this fight for sovereignty and self-defense Ukraine," wrote President Lloyd Austen in Twitter, setting up a video meeting with a Ukrainian colleague.
Ukrainian military authorities had earlier expressed the hope that at their next "Ramstein" meeting, partners might have decided on how to give combat planes Western samples and long-run missiles.
Kiev also expects the allies to announce the exact number and duration of the tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants to ban Russian artists in the EU - DW - 14.02,2023
Ukraine is collecting data about Russian cultural leaders actively promoting the policy of Russian President Vladimir Putin, supporting Russia's war against Ukraine, or working in institutions and organizations sponsored by the RF State to include them in a new EU sanctuary package.
Galina Gregorenko, a deputy minister of culture and information policy in Ukraine, reported on in an DW interview.
Culture as Russia's Guns
According to Gregorenko, Russia is using the culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and to justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of their interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum is very clear that the exhibition on museum scenes abroad is their special operation," says Gregorenko.
She thinks it's impossible to talk to Russia today because of culture.
Thus, Ukrainian artists often refuse to speak on a stage in Europe with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained to the deputy minister of Ukraine's culture.
So recently, the choir of the National Opera and the National Philharmonic orchestra of Ukraine refused to speak on one stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebco, who in 2012 was registered as a trustee of Vladimir Putin in his pre-electeral campaign, and in 2014, she supported the actions of pro - Russian fighters of the so-called D.R. on Donbas.

The European Union officially deprives Russian artists of the possibility of seeing
But Gregorko's belief, it's not enough for those RFs who support Putin's policies, is still very successful in Europe.
"If you want to cancel these tours officially, you have to have a nickname in the European sanctimonious list," says Gregorenko, adding: "We're working on getting RF leaders who are promoting Russian nags outside of Russia to become part of the next sanctimonious pack.
This will enable the EU to officially ban its economic activities, including concerts.
According to Gregorenko, this question is addressed in Ukraine by the Ministry of Economics, the National Corruption Prevention Agency, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, and the special work force at the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As noted earlier, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Layen, at a joint press conference with the president of Ukraine, Vladimir Green, in Brussels, February 9, said that on February 9, he had asked her to form sanctions against Russian propagandaists in Kiev.
She promised that many propaganda men would be included in the centenarian list of ten packs.
Ukraine has its own legal list of cultural and media relations with RF, which contains over 300 surnames.

The U.S. is willing to sell to Poland HIMARS, ATACMS rockets and another 10 billion dollar military equipment.
The U.S. Department approved a possible sale of military equipment and services in Poland for about $10 billion.
Jeff Seldin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Voice, referred to the Pentagon Agency for Defense Cooperation (DSCA).
It's primarily about the high-moil artillery M142 HIMARS rockets, ATACMS rockets, GMLRS bombs, and other military equipment.
"This kind of acquisition should support the whole external policy and the United States national security by raising the security of the NATO member, which is the power of political stability and economic progress in Europe," says the Agency.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and maintain regional threats.
In all, Poland requested the following equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS;
- 468 sets of HIMARS boot device module
-45 Army M57 Tactical Systems (ATACMS);
- 1514 Capsipulators of GMLRS (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
The agreement also includes rockets, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications, technical data, personnel training, system integration, engineering and logic services, U.S. government and contractors, education, sensors, other related elements of material and software.
According to the Bloomberg edition, new equipment complements launch installations purchased in the United States in 2019 that have not yet been added.
Warsaw also invited missiles from South Korea, " reports the publication.
Hensec NATO urged the United States to prepare for the long war of RF in Ukraine
The ability to send Ukraine's fighters to defend itself in the war against the RF -- not removed from the agenda, declared Prime Minister of Great Britain Richie Sunak during a press conference with President Vladimir Green of Ukraine.
"The first step in providing advanced planes is to have soldiers or airliners who can use them.
It's a process that takes some time.
We started this process today, " said Sunnak about a previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
- Nothing is taken from the agenda, and our leadership in this matter is what we should all be proud of together.
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would be in Ukraine for "the next month" and that Ukraine "never should be vulnerable to attack" and that it would be "in the short term" but to strengthen Ukraine in the long term.
He said that Great Britain agreed to expand its training program, which in the last six months prepared 10,000 military personnel, and promised, as CNN writes, "to accelerate the delivery of our equipment to ensure Ukraine's achievement on the front line in the coming days and weeks, not the years."
President Green during a press conference expressed appreciation for Ukraine's support: "Today, it is clear that we have support for Great Britain.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for those 350 days of unity.
Also, speaking of the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he repeated again a call to Ukraine for western fighters and added that he "heard from Mr. Prime Minister that he wished to grant a fighter" to Kyiv.
The Russian embassy in London has already declared that Britain's decision to give Ukraine fighters will have military consequences for the world.
Dmitri Kouléba, a foreign minister, said on Twitter that Kiev was still talking with western partners about the possibility of a warplane: "I spoke to the Dutch Foreign Minister Vopke Hookster to coordinate our international steps, as the full-scale invasion of Russia is approaching the annual mark.
I thanked you for your final dance decision.
I was also raising the question about F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others about combat aviation.
U.S. spokesman George Ignat, in a comment for CNN, stated that Ukraine will need dozens of Western combat planes to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, researchers say that the West has a little time to help Ukraine with new military techniques before Russia's anticipated new invasion in spring or even February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin has been trying to regain a large offensive in Ukraine since early January.

In order to prevent the vaccine from happening, "policy and profit."
The director - general of the World Health Organization stated on Sunday that if countries don't use existing instruments effectively to fight the pandemic, they won't be able to end it.
"Pandemia will end when the world has decided to end it," said Tedros Ada Hebreess, speaking in the World Health Summit, a global forum in Germany.
"We have all the tools we need - effective health care and effective medical tools.
But the world has used these tools badly," said Tedros, turning to participants from 100 countries around the world.
In the way to achieve the goal of the World Health Organization, 40 percent of the population of each country from the Corauvira is "policy and profit," said WHO's director, "not production."
"The children who have reached the goal of 40%, including all the G-20 countries, must give up their seat in line for delivery of vaccines in favor of COVAX and the African vaccine fund," said Tedros.
COVAX is the international initiative of cooperation for a fair distribution of a vaccine against COVID.
Gebreesus also stressed that no country can bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic apart from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperation for the protection of other nations.
Together!" remarked Hebreess on the social network Twitter.
WHO's official representative also urged vaccine manufacturers to "prefer to and to carry out their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African vaccine fund]" and become "more transparent about where it is directed."
AVAT is the initiative of the African Union to ensure access to vaccines against COVID-19 across Africa.
He called for vaccine manufacturers to trade nou-hau, technology and licenses and give up intellectual property rights.
Earlier, Carren Atita, a writer for The Washington Post, called for the U.S. administration to share the "recept" vaccine with the world.
"The U.S. administration has broken down on vaccines that she has donated in the world.
But when a rich country uses vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, it's not a good-serious philanthropy; it's a superior.
The poorer countries didn't ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they initially asked for a fair opportunity," said the columnist.
"We're not asking for charity," said Tedros, "we're calling for intelligent investment in global recovery."
According to Gloss America, earlier this year Bayden's administration called for to refuse the patent protection for a vaccine against COVID-19.
That refusal is intended by the U.S. administration to allow poorer countries to produce patented vaccines.
There were pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, and so forth.
In August the pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced an increase in the cost of their vaccines against the cohoravirus.
The John Hopkins Resource Center announced Monday that 243.7 million global infections of COVID and almost 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, almost 7 billion vaccines were introduced.

And Andrzej Duda, president of Poland, declared that sending an F-16 aircraft to Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" which would be "hard to make."
One of Ukraine's closest allies stated this in an interview with the CNN telecom in front of a discussion of Ukraine's new arms supply.
In Warsaw, in an exclusive interview on Sunday, President Duda said that sending planes to F-16 would create a serious problem for Poland because the Polish Air Force has fewer than 50 planes, and the Poles themselves don't have enough... and we're going to need much more.
And that's what Dida said, that combat planes, like F-16, have a very serious service need, so it's not enough to just send a few planes.
These remarks by President Duda have been heard against the background of discussions about new arms supplies in Ukraine, including Western tanks and more ancient antiracial installations.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw strongly persuaded its allies to send Patriot and western tanks, such as the German Leopard.

In his speech to the members of the European Parliament, Green said that "very grateful" for the help given, and hopes that further negotiations on air travel will also be successful.
"I heard from some European leaders about being willing to give us the weapons we need, including air.
Now I've got a bunch of two-way negotiations, and we're going to raise questions of fighters and other aviation.
So we continue our work here in Brussels," said Greenski.
Last week, the Polish Prime Minister Mateus Morewewick reported that his country was ready to pass on its F-16 fighters to Ukraine in full coordination with the Nato countries.
And last month, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Vopke Huxtra, said that his government would consider Kiev's request for F-16.
At the beginning of the month, President Joe Bayen denied the supply of F-16 planes from the United States, but Western experts believe that these planes can be sent to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that before, weapons that had been refused to provide for the United States eventually ended up in Ukraine if it was agreed to be passed on by the European Allies to NATO.

SCRIPTURES, Moldova (AP)
On Monday, President Moldova declared the plot of Moscow to use external diversizers to overthrow the country's government, overthrow Russia, and destroy its desire to join the European Union.
It was a week after the president of Ukraine, Vladimir Green, claimed that his country had intercepted plans for Russian special forces to destroy Moldova, which were later confirmed by representatives of Moldova's intelligence.
"Plan for the next period is going to engage divers with military training, camouflaged into civilian clothing, resorting to force, attack some state buildings, and even capture the hostages," said Sanda to journalists for a briefing.
"The point of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional system, to change Kisin's legitimate power to illegal, " said Sandu, "that would take our country to Russia and stop the process of Eurointegration. "
She promised, "Trying the Kremlin to bring violence to our country won't succeed."
Russian officials refused to respond to Sandu's claims.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.6 million, has endeavored to develop closer relationships with its Western partners.
Last June, she became a candidate for the European Union, the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December the Moldovan police and the intelligence and security service (SIS) intervened in "a number of cases of organized criminal activity and ended the attempts of violence. "
In the last year, Moldova, who is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of problems.
These include a serious energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supply; rapid inflation; and a number of incidents in the last few months involving rockets that crossed airspace and debris found in its territory.
Moldova's authorities confirmed that another war-time missile in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sanda stated that Russia wanted to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information received by the Special Forces contained what she called instructions on how to enter Moldova for the citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and to keep things under control," said Sanda.
She said that Moldova's Parliament had to pass legislation to ensure that the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, as well as the prosecutor's "unneeded tools" for a more effective fight against the risk to the country's security.
The president added that the plan "will rely on several internal forces, but especially criminal groups," and went on to the names of two Moldovan oliarchs, Ilana Shora and Vladimir Placholnyuk, both of whom are now in exile.
Last year U.S. sanctions and Great Britain were launched against both men.
Last fall a series of massive anti-governmental protests, organized by the populist party of the Shara party in Russia, also struck Moldova in an energy crisis.
The presidential press briefing was held Monday after he resigned the prime minister to Moldova, Natalie Gavrilo, on Friday.
That same day, Sandu appointed his defense and security adviser, an advanced economist, Doreen Rechain, successor to Gavrilo.
On Friday, after Moldova's government confirmed a missile incident, U.S. deputy spokesman Wedant Patel stated to the U.S. National Department that "The Russia has supported the campaign of influence and destabilization in Moldova, which often predicts the use of corruption in the form of weapons to achieve its aims."

You say the same thing every time you do, you notice Varta very much, stirring the ice in a cocktail.
In winter, it will freeze because it is cold and wet.
In spring, it's raining again...
ʽSidila would have been her own Carpathah, and clenched her shoulders without care.
Although the city did not like her so much.
It dissolves the beauty of its past into haste and fussyness.
The girl liked to picture familiar streets as calm, quiet, and greener than a hundred years ago or ever.
But there's no magic that allows us to go back to the past.
▸ Pach!
Say something like that! (Laughter)
Unless you loved it from morning till night, to take the grass, to hang them under the ceiling, and to sing old orders.
'Cause the grandmother ran round, that without a word, none of my potions will be as good as they should be.
And wait, I haven't mentioned picking up all the other nights!...

Because of these movies, most people think women go into prostitution for a good life, and they like work like it, that it's their conscious choice, and so on.
But if you really start to understand the subject, it's getting scary...
The problem now is particularly severe when it comes to the prostitution of Ukrainian women.
There's a problem.
Our present president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution... so I didn't treat him very well.
I think we have to look at Sweden's experience, and there's a kind of Swedish model.
It's not a woman. It's a customer.
Women help get out of this business and make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security or social security at all.
I hope the civilized world will support the Swedish model because there is no hope for anything anymore.
Men also do well to consider what they buy - "content " or violence....
There's another need... you can see where the nearest optics are with the doctor to write the prescription on the glasses.
And the excuse to buy quality... and to look at some tax sites, it was nice to know it was cheaper here than it was in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses two years ago, paid about $300 for them, and was in the middle level (or even below).
I don't know what the costs at the store are, but the prices in online stores are pretty normal.
But as for some cosmetics, I can tell you that this is more expensive.
There's a lot more.
We have multifocal lenses in our glasses that are very expensive (this is compared to our average wages).
Given our family budget (especially the fact that we have to rent a house), $300 for glasses is quite high.
Didn't the doctors offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I had been using soft contact lenses for 10 years, and then I started to have the integrity of the lens, and a year after that, I wore hard lenses, and I started to get very allergic to almost all the cosmetics.
I've worn eyeglasses for four years, and the lenses are very rare.
Yes, I have also read that the commission affects the eyesight.
Also, after 40 years there is a need for glasses to read.
My mother was offered multiple glasses, the price was more than $1,000, and it was very expensive.
Yes, the glasses are now fashionable.
I asked one doctor why he didn't wear a lens or make a laser correction, so he said glasses were stylish.
For a pensioner with a pension of 1,500 dollars, that's not a lot of money.
I'm getting my glasses covered.
Yeah.
My mother doesn't have enough employment.
She had little work to do, at first little children who were often ill, then took care of her grandmother... so the State gave her a minimum pension.
Father gets 3,800 dollars, 40 years old.
My salary was about 8,000 dollars, and all that money had to be paid for rent.
In good times there was a bonus, but with quarantine there was no order to test plant material from farmers.
As a result, many Ukrainians go abroad to work to provide for their family or to purchase maps, but they lose contact with the family....
Yes, there are positives.
But if my husband has a day off, he's on his way.)
Good night.
In accordance with the order from the day of his official publication, the seaports of Burdiansk, Mariopolis, Skadońsk, are closed to restore control of the established seaports.
It is indicated that such decisions are not meant to be carried out by boat and passengers, to ensure proper safety of ships, and to protect the environment in these regions of war, which endangers life and health.
The Russian Federation uses the troll factory to spread war and foreign politicians.
According to correspondent Uckinform, Reuters reported on this, referring to the U.K. ISS.
The United Kingdom's report on Sunday stated that the dew uses a troll factory to spread social networking information about war in Ukraine and politicians in some countries, including Britain and South Africa.
It is said that these conclusions came from an expert study.
The authorities stated that the study found exactly how the Krellian Information Campaign was working, maneuvering international public opinion on the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support, and attracting new fans, " writes Reuters.
According to the study, the troll factory used the Telegram to attract and coordinate the new supporters who later acted against the critique critics, accusing them of commenting on the support of the president of the chain and his war.
British ministers and other world leaders were among the targets of the factory.
The operations have been identified on eight social networks, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok.
Britain's Foreign Minister Liz Tras stated on this point that its government has already ordered international partners and will continue to work closely with the allies and the media platforms to destroy Russian information operations.
" We can't let the marble and its shadow mills sneak into our online spaces with lies about causal illegal war, " concluded Tras.
Joanna, I'm going to explain it to you now.
You have so much hair structure that all hair is basically the same length.
Very few short slots.
To achieve the maximum possible smooth results, you need to either blind your hair.
But hair density can be greatly affected.
That's why I didn't do it.
Or make the dyeing of the roots to make the crossing more smooth.
I didn't paint roots on your request either.
So the transition can be a little harsh.
I can melt your crossing, but you're gonna have to decorate your roots.
The roots are going to be painted under your color, so when your hair grows, you don't notice the difference.
The quality of the hair.
Unfortunately, any decoloration affects the quality of the hair.
Hair can become dryer, that's normal, because it's a flea.
Without loss of quality, such diamonds cannot be made.
If you do the right thing for hair care, that hair condition will go back to normal.
Please write down the care you use by Matricks.
Maybe it's too weak for a blonde.
We can write down for free tones to make a smoother transition.
This picture also has a pretty dramatic transition.
Because large percentage of Blonde is in a restricted zone.
Please write down if you'd be able to drive over so I can see.
If we do tonsing, it'll take about three hours.
So much positive from what I do at my job.
I'm helping people, and that's what I wanted to do.
Be that way, but it's a help to people who, at least, no one in the world helps and says with a smile at the "good day's" heart.
Found great basic science lessons in Czech today on the Internet.
I'm cleaning rooms here in the morning, where there's no talking, while I'm alone, and the door in these three rooms is closed.
I listen to my headphones and repeat the lecture.
On the other hand, I'm talking to myself, but it's good that at the time, no one can see me or hear me I think an hour a day I can learn a language like this.
So another huge contribution to this is learning the language in headphones and in practice talking to colleagues.
In the last hundred years, Russia has carried out 31 military campaigns.
It lasted the longest period of peace for 12 years: between the invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of Russia's present - day territory was occupied by nomadic tribes, which greatly influenced the cultural nature of the Russians.
The cult of invaders and raids has succeeded throughout Russia's history: in the Russian Empire, in the Soviet Union, and then in the Soviet regime of 20 years.
These cultural characteristics have formed national institutions that foster hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of war because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other nations.
The Russians had not yet experienced the full effect of economic sanctions.
Their standard of living has not deteriorated to such an extent that it provokes massive protest movements inside the RF.
Therefore, ask for more sanctions to move Russians to change their country from within!
Russia threatens a new Chernobyl and Fukusima.
Russian troops shoot and capture nuclear power plants in Ukraine.
Chernobyl's destruction.
The tanks were shot and taken under control by the SS, the largest in Europe.
Russian rockets have also been fixed over the South Ukrainian region.
Russia's actions violate the 15th article of the Geneva Convention, which forbids the attack of the EC.
Attacking rockets, overheating reactors, or running fuel because of power failure and water can lead to radiation leaks.
Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors.
Russia does not have to press the יהוה red button to cause a global catastrophe.
To support Ukraine, the Russian threat can only be overcome together!
The Russians plunder Ukrainian farmers and illegally import grain, fuel, agrotechnics, and early crops from Ukraine.
These incidents are recorded in four regions of Ukraine that have been temporarily occupied by RF.
This is a well - known policy in Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyar country agreed on a decision about the harvest surplus last year and this year.
Occupational authorities take seed materials from the Agrarians, but at the same time, they demand a successful planting to send new crops to Russia.
It forbids paying taxes to the country's civil servants.
In the event of a disagreement, ▪ Threatenes physical harm.
Russia repeats Soviet policy of mass looting Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
So it started with a famine in 1932 or 33 and it destroyed private property in Ukrainian land.
In the view of the Nazi Civil War, Russia in particular provokes famine in occupied areas and destroys Ukraine as a rival in the international food market.
Don't buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country give up any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers taking their children hostage in temporary occupied territory in Ukraine.
They force their mothers to investigate the position of Ukrainian troops for refusing to kill children.
People are pushed into hard choices, such as losing their children or becoming traitors to their homeland and being punished for doing so.
Sophia Denisova, a human rights authority in Ukraine, has repeatedly reported mass kidnappings of orphans by child orphans by an outlaw.
They are taken to Russia and returned to the Russian - speaking family.
Putin even initiated a change in legislation for an accelerated adoption procedure from Donbasa.
Call out your power and the international community to prevent Ukrainian children from being kidnapped!
I wish Ukraine had entered the natto, but I don't like their indecisiveness.
Because they do not close the sky above Ukraine, thousands will die.
More than 50,000 civilians have been killed.
Yet, without a Western weapon, we would be powerless, but I have to say that it comes with limited quantity and late.
However, we need to become members of nato for the sake of our future.
I think it's good for the alliance itself, because with the natto arms and the 9-year-old war against the swarm, our army is the most effective European army.
Did you know that the Ukrainians invented a way to reload the nlaw antitank complex?
I think Americans take these warheads off the ground at the launch stage.
The Russians deserve the worst and the worst that you can imagine.
So I'm kind of excited about what's going on.
Because this war isn't going on for four months, it started in about the 15th century, I definitely don't remember now.
But all these hundreds of years are trying to make us slaves.
Before one generation dies, another generation is born and takes on a fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished, and now they have returned.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so it's our chance to destroy Russia as a state.
It's hard for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the shortness of events, I didn't have time to think, to undo the very fact that war is going on and what it means to me.
Here's the great thing, but I need to learn the language and go to work and I can't sit around keeping the Czech state, but the problem is my husband doesn't want me to go back to work, and he'll have to go back to Ukraine and stay, but he'll do it so we can go back.
Doesn't want us to live here with his answer.
So he's glad we're here but to sit at home all the time I'm taking the kids to school and swimming, so I'm gonna ask him to stay here after the war and he says we're gonna go home right away, he won't make us papers.
I'm sure I can't leave if he's got a long walk and he can't afford to let the kids go to Czechia.
Long-term beat.
I want to know when the war's over for the barber and then tell him to take us to Czechia if he doesn't want to, then he'll probably have to go to the lawyer. He'll have to do something early. But here he clearly told us we're going home right after the war.
We're going home, but I know he won't take us to Czechia when he's in Ukraine.
So thank you. Let's get out of the situation, head for the war to end!
No, he doesn't have anyone at the moment. I think the reason why kids want a lot of things in Czechia is to ask him for toys is to go to his head, yell, run around the house. And he's used to the rest that no one cares and doesn't ask for anything. And here we come and he gets annoyed and we need to spend money and he's very frugal. So he's better off if we live in Ukraine.
Behind the window, the train was packed with fine gray rain, Marchs, and Christmas trees, coated with black and white confetti forty, anxious water-tight, and goods.
Comrade Orlrve was a member of an iron bed that was familiar to him, since it was no different from a narrow Spartan bed in his home.
He opened an unsmart set of unsightly arrangements for a live bread and a spruce wrapped in gray cloth.
Orlovo's roommate was inconsequential in food, and he was inconspicuous in life, and he's long forgotten how much people enjoy life and enjoy themselves so simply because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he leaned over an old blow-up chest and gently removed the two palms of the crystal dome, which dimly sparkled in gray light of the middle bar.
What do you have, comrade?
-Rarith,--with tenderness, unexpected to himself, said Comrade Orlow, safely holding his skull on a compartmental table--such, you see, the thing -- a very interesting and exciting thing.
It's kind of like, my friend...
Yeah, I'm looking at five sites.
But unfortunately I find work for men for special education.
I don't know Czech, I'm a little kid teacher, I'm not an engineer, I don't have a driver's license.
And it's also a big issue of housing.
It's my first time abroad, and I just don't know what to do or how to do it.
I can't find a job for a month, just cleaning the house.
I realize that Prague is a difficult situation, so I don't even go there.
Here I've got a problem in every place I've been abroad for the first time, I don't know the language, and I'm completely alone.

Unfortunately, now the situation is that I have to hold on to the free house while it is.
And looking around for work.
Or find a job.
I don't see any other options.
I don't want to just sit, because the house won't be free for long.
I understand.
I don't want to charge you with money.
I don't want to think of lazy people in Ukraine being influenced by others.
I just want to find a job and a living room in a normal city, not in the capital.
The rough road from Ukraine lasted for three days and the big city where I was frightened by a foreign language.
I didn't come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
It's to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Do you know anyone in small cities?
I can take care of my children, cook food, clean, work in the garden...
I can sew, I have to learn how to sew on a sewing machine.
I made bed linen and some clothes.
Maybe a job like that.
I can do it!

Thank you for the letter, and I'm expressing my personal position, which doesn't always match the opinion of other psychologists in Ukraine.
I think the issue of eliminating or eliminating the association of Russian psychologists in European associations is very unforgivable.
Members of the organization may feel differently about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, protecting basic human rights and the right to life is the key.
I'll give you an analogy.
If one child takes a toy from another child in the sandbox, it is more likely that adults who look after their children will try to get their children to die, and after a while the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox starts to beat the other child's face with a shovel, the child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him.
I liked the analogy of a Russian psychopathic colleague about the fact that when someone in a neighboring apartment kills someone, the entire apartment building is not put in prison.
There is a lot of debate among Ukrainian psychologists on the elimination of Russian associations with Europe that many feel the pain that can't stand communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I'm willing to continue to cooperate with several Russian psychologists that I know and to share knowledge to treat customer injuries on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and I have Russian clients who strongly condemn Russian troops' attack on Ukraine and who, at their level, are trying to do a lot of things for the development of public values in Russia.
So I'm definitely taking a different approach to different people and different organizations.
I'm convinced that war in Russia backs 5 to 10 percent of the population, and other numbers in social surveys add propaganda.
My wife left her native country of Ukraine because of the war there.
The wife had a fine job and had never left her home in war.
In order not to sit on my wife's neck in the Czech Republic, she is struggling to earn money, since in 2009 she received a massager certificate in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, everyone makes money as much as he can.
Now there's only one problem with learning Czech.
She teaches, works, and earns herself and a child for food, kindergarten, bus fare, mobile clothing service.
And I am protecting my homeland at this time.
Thank you for helping people who understand that.
Thank you, Czech Republic, for providing shelter for women and children from Ukraine in times of distress.
I want to thank you for being able to put my wife's massage service commercial in your community.
The wife earns her money because she does not want to live for the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
This really helps my wife to earn money for her family.
Okay, I'll give it to my wife.
I understand that many citizens don't understand the state of the Ukrainian people.
Some people smile at my wife's announcement, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, and I work for the police, but the war has separated us.
It's a good thing my wife wants to work and earn money and not expect help from your republic.
Look out!
That's it!
Good evening, my brothers and sisters)

Keeping an eye on the students at school, during breaks, and at school meetings.
Safety conditions while in gyms, playgrounds, and professional classrooms
Remote learning rules
If this is not possible with the introduction of an extraordinary set or quarantine
The personal presence of the students at school, the school, provides the students with a remote education.
If a remote learning method is ordered in a school (class), students are obliged to do so.
The Most Important Safety Rules
School and school activities, in particular, forbid the bringing of things that threaten health and security
weapons (including knives), drugs (drugs), cigarettes, and alcohol.
Smoking and alcohol or other drugs at school are prohibited in school and on the Internet.
I really need someone to translate into a Czech insurance company.
On our way to the Czech Republic, while we were on our way to Romania, a Romanian citizen was hit by our car.
So now we're dealing with an insurance company to fix a car.
Fear was invited by a person who, during a technical examination of a machine, could translate from Czech into Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa.
Can you help me with the translator?
In particular, I have experience writing a little science paper based on statistical analysis of lizard body settings of different ages and genders in a single population.
Besides, I also have experience in working close to my speciality in directions.
In 2020-2021, I participated in research at the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped to monitor Kharkiv bat populations as well as to organize winters for bats that people cared about during the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my social skills and learned how to interest others in an important topic of biodiversity conservation.
In the Ukrainian university, I was also able to read the sciences about the noises, observe their activity under a microscope, and communicate with research scientists.
So the variation of a much deeper study of these and other microscopic organisms is also of interest to me.
How did the EU's policy change and why it doesn't pay for refugees?
Poland and Czech Republic do not receive help from refugees from the European Union. This is the most discussed theme at meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited Czechia at the invitation of Milosz Zeman.
President of the Czech Republic noted that since the start of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become a major advocate of European values and has taken over many problems.
She gave shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with the housing and provided financial assistance.
The Czech Republic was about 500 feet [500 m] away.
Ukrainians will never forget the powerful support of neighbors in Poland and Czech Republic and their untiring thanks!
How Poland experiences the unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden of ProUkrainu's editorial asked Jaroslav Kotom, the coordinator and translator of the Lublin Refugee Center.
He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and regional analysts, representing not only Poland but Canada, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan as well.
How Poland Helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic has accepted half a million Ukrainians and this has had a significant impact on the lives of the Czechs.
Governments have large queues, high prices in stores.
What is going on in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government was outstandingly organized and began to provide assistance when military action began.
That was foretold.
In Poland it has been said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, there was less preparation for what was going to happen, and in Poland there was an active preparation.
So, for example, in the border areas of Poland and Ukraine before the war broke out, there were plans already for refugees from Ukraine.
In Ukraine, we didn't even think this could happen.
I heard that I was smiling at the fear of Poland for refugees.
But this was very much under way: preparing for these events before the war began.
I say, there's been a huge amount of money from regional and national budgets to help Ukrainians escape bombings from Russian aggression.
First of all, we've got help in the logistically-based transfer of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical, injured, and sick ones.
These are airplanes that move between the cities in Poland, and they also travel to the EU's major countries.
I had experience in working with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania, and Spain from Lublin.
Although Lublin's town is as big as Luczek, it's not millions of dollars as someone else thinks it is.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, payments for passage for Ukrainians were canceled.
They are free to travel on trains and public transportation.
In addition, Poland agreed with German transporters who arranged for free trains to travel to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees are free to go to places where they plan to stay.
The second question is how refugees live in things that are designed for local self - government.
Most of these are closed school stadiums, where temporary beds are arranged.
It's got free food, free medical first aid.
Refugees have a chance to rest and stay for a few days, and they are already there looking for opportunities to move to a more comfortable environment.
Large cities of Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wroclaw, where whole Ukrainian blocks are now being formed.
Warsaw's example as a whole is unique in that they were able to get from the RF embassy to get rid of objects that were abandoned by the inhabitants of this embassy.
Large housing complexes have been neglected for decades, but the Russians have not allowed anyone to enter.
This was nationalized by the Polish authorities, let's say.
She took advantage of Ukrainians to live with Ukrainian families.
These are apartment buildings, where 200 to 300 families can be located at the same time.
Water will be brought there, electricity will run away.
Within a week or two, there can already be refugees from Ukraine.
The third aspect is social aid.
After 24 February, Poland took a unique step: Seym accepted, and the Senate passed a law on fugitives from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the legal right to stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without permission, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law includes health care.
There is also a private fund, which has set aside ten million zlotys for free medical care to the Ukrainians.
You just have to text me, get the code on the phone.
And in a 5,000-dollar check, it's free to get medicine in Poland.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys that are offered to every refugee in Ukraine regardless of age.
Common funds, including Caritas, the Red Cross, provide food packages, chemistry, and clothing.
As the Poles say,
So this is a situation that has no analogity.
Such a huge openness.
It's a huge expense for the Polish state.
The European Union has not selected Poland until now.
In fact, this is a huge blow to the Polish budget.
What's the biggest problem with adapting Ukrainians in Poland?
A language problem.
The questions begin with a clinic where Ukrainians cannot cope without a translator.
Often with difficult problems, illnesses.
The second problem is that schools, especially high school students in particular at first, cannot understand terminology at all.
It is noted that Ukrainian children often come with knowledge much higher than in the right classroom.
This is often surprising to Polish teachers.
Children not only know English well, but they're generally higher than the class they're in.
That's interesting, too.
So the Ukrainian education system is good.
And in fact, kids are good at learning in Ukraine if they're so tall here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Sadly, an employee who worked as a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer, in Ukraine is far more difficult to master.
Lawyer or accountant, I don't know such cases at all.
Doctors are now appearing in certain centers, including Lüblin, and they have created their own little clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
It's a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors are able to adopt the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
A language problem often causes families to return home after a few weeks here.
There are so many such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees running away in the first few weeks of the war, now they're coming back.
This is Transcarpathia and western regions of Ukraine where there is no such active warfare.
They didn't learn here, they didn't find a job.
Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and will be more convenient for them to return home.
This too is one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How the Ukrainians Have Changed
Ukraine's ambassador to the Czech Republic made significant changes.
If the Czech society used to view Ukrainians as exceptional migrants, it is now proud of the stability of the Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do the Poles view millions of Ukrainian refugees?
Poland has a similar situation.
Here all television channels often quote the expression of Poland's president, Leha Kaczynski, who died tragically in Smolensk.
When Russia was attacked in Georgia, with President Yuschenek and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.
There said a significant phrase that Russian aggression would probably not stop on Georgia, and then it could be Ukraine.
Then there could be the Baltic countries, they could also go to Poland.
I mean, he could have predicted it.
In fact, the Ukrainians are now protecting Poland with their own blood, their devotion, by their heroic acts.
Since Poland and the Poles appreciate this, they open their homes to help such unselfish Ukrainian refugees.
There's a threat in Poland.
Although Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war can also knock on our door.
That led to a change in attitude toward the positive.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem, is now not known as the Nationalists'song.
Of course, there are small groups among the population that have not changed their views, and they are in every country.
Fortunately, though, most citizens in society now think quite differently about Ukrainians than before.
The nationalist statement in Ukraine is funny.
Putin and other Russian politicians maintain that in Ukraine, nationalists must be eliminated.
It's taken for granted in Poland because these so-called nationalists have turned out to be completely different people, and they don't have any political overtones.
This must be surprising, for this direct contact has affected the public opinion of those who have questioned some historical matters.
Now it was found that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
Poles, when they begin to think that there could be a war, immediately realize that they wouldn't be able to resist and give up their lives as they are now in Ukraine.
People from Mariupol, Bushy, and other Ukrainian cities are constantly being talked about.
How Poland Accepts Russia's Threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but prepares for the worst scenario because there's a terrible war going on.
But Poland and Czech Republic are now seriously concerned about their own safety, and they have already received threats.
Russia fears that it will strike with nuclear weapons for supporting Ukraine.
How do the authorities and the Polish community react?
You want peace to get ready for war.
In fact, Poland does this, and it has very good contacts with the United States, other Nato countries.
The military congress grew.
Today, there is an additional body of territorial defense in Poland.
So this kind of preparation for different military scenarios happens.
It's a feeling for citizens that the state is preparing for these events.
In the midst of this and recently adopted fatherland defense law, where the budget has been greatly raised for Poland's military needs.
Military requirements have been changed, many points which are actually associated with a potential militaristic threat.
I know you as a professional analyst in the future.
Your predictions became reality in Syria, and you warned me of Russia's attack.
What do you think when Ukraine's victory is over and the world's warning of a nuclear war?
This is the worst scenario.
As for the nuclear strike, I don't really believe it.
But there's a scenario like this.
Such a nuclear blow should be more visible to the Nato countries, and also to Poland.
It could have happened, by different estimates, in the region of the Volin area.
Notice, I wouldn't want that, but this is the worst scenario.
A small kick, but to make all the television channels show this  Andr?
To be seen from Poland, the Baltic States.
In this case, the Russians are expecting an escape and a loss of Nato troops.
Positive scenarios have to do with the loss of physical and financial Russian troops, the problems of Putin's environment, the oligarchs who are now suffering from financial problems, the various regional problems in Russia.
We have the facts of the fire of the HES in Saalina, and there's some evidence that people are starting to resent prices.
Such regional problems will affect the unity of the Russian state.
In one of my forecasts, I wrote that Russia would collapse into 19 small countries.
There are also trends for peaceful settlement of war.
The various countries in the EU, including Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their need for Russian energy.
It's going to take as long as this year's end.
Living Without Russian Gas
The Czech Republic is discussing the possibility of a gas stop.
This is going to be a very tangible blow, because Czechia is dependent on Russian gas for almost 100%.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped shipping gas to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Because I'm an analyst, I predicted it.
I just switched off the gas in my house in advance.
My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.
But there's a huge number, there's millions of Polish families that will experience rising prices.
People won't experience it for the first few months, but definitely the price of all of the resources will start to go up.
Now they're looking for different ways to look at certain alternative sources.
In addition, there are several companies that carry the gas to Poland, and there is a huge port in Poland.
As for oil, we have a powerful factor that the prime minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Now there's going to be a ransom for gas stations in Poland, actually Hungarian companies that are going to use Russian oil.
These are also subjects that are very painful and that deal with geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe had refused Russian power carriers, it would have lost the source of RF funding for its troops.
Even a schoolboy realizes, without selling oil and gas, Russia will just lose its possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish Media
Vladimir Greenski interviewed a Polish media organization.
What do Polish media reveal about this?
The rating of the president of Ukraine has greatly increased.
And this growth is judged as unprecedented.
Vladimir Green, thank you for your help, and he's talking about the real things that are happening next to him, and he's in a city in the war zone.
That is, the president's actions are ranked both by politicians and analysts and by the authorities as very active.
They show that the Ukrainian authorities are as targeted as possible to provide military and financial assistance to provide refugees who move out of Ukraine.
The media discuss these topics in a very positive context with regard to the Ukrainian authorities.
There's no negative that sometimes happens in the U.S. on a particular occupation or regional problem.
I can't hear it here.
And I think that's very good, because Ukraine's image of heroism, of endurance, of its ability to fight the enemy has grown dramatically.
It doesn't die and it doesn't fall.
That's the most important, so there's no Imigres.
Ukraine's image is actually holding up, and that's very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to bother you again.
I'm very uncomfortable and ashamed of complaining to you.
Yesterday they tried to come to something, but it was futile.
A friend of the mother - in - law helped find the apartment.
Said she wasn't looking for her for us, and if we're not happy with something, it's just that we're going to have to leave and she's going to make sure she's the mother-in-law, not us, stay here.
Sadly, none of them think of the child who is used to it, sees it as his home, and within three months, six homes have changed.
I'm so sorry, I couldn't guess what would happen.
I'm sorry I'm getting you into trouble again.
The situation may seem strange as far as the bed is concerned.
We discussed the matter with my husband before I wrote that you didn't need a bed.
He came here to see me and the baby, and he really wanted to sleep and wake up with his family.
And her mother - in - law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in her room and spit in his mind and desire.
I'm very ashamed of you, your husband, the Sharka and Jan, the landlady.
That's how you tried for us.
Got it.
I thought it would go on for some long term.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andriy's treatment, to do that at least until the end of summer?
You may need help with Andrey's illness.
In Ukraine this condition would have been diagnosed as disability.
And just like Inna doesn't go to the garden yet, I don't have a chance to go out to work, at least out of the house.
I understand it would be nice to go with you tomorrow.
I'll do a stroke code for myself and Andriy.
I'm sorry to stop giving aid to him, and it's gonna take a while for treatment and rehabilitation.
Can you give advice?
I also wanted to ask you, did you get the money for the drugs you bought for Andriy?
The handle crackes out.
It is short, so you must be very careful and not lose it.
Only 2 portions were sold today.
The apricot is over.
The mangoes.
Mangoes don't go too well.
Most apricots wanted to go.
They're taking more vanilla now because they don't like mangoes.
Norm, mango.
But the violin began again
We started actively taking ice cream and it's not working.
Tomorrow's gonna be a black snot.
# Tonight's exactly the end of the mango and the black snooze #
I'm shaking all over.
He freezes again, squeaks.
Hudson at 4.0.
As soon as active people take it, he doesn't miss any ice cream at all.
And yet there is more to it than that.
It's just that the queue becomes behind the ice cream line, it starts giving off these nuances, and people go on.
It's going to freeze.
If there's no ice cream, it's going to squeak and it's going to dry.
You can't have a mango bathroom.
Magdalena can come at 8:00 tomorrow?
We should wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is over and tomorrow's taste is different.
You'll be home in the evening so we'll pay for last month.
Thank you very much when it suits you on Sunday or Saturday.

First Child Survives
My Czech Learning Story began a week after we arrived in Czechia
And met me with a lot of interesting people.
When we started learning Czech and getting to know a lot of interesting people,
At first, I was volunteering.
it was a man of a historian who came after work to explain basic things in the Czech Republic
It was the first time to learn a language with a native speaker who knows neither Ukrainian nor Russian at all.
You were a very funny process.
and we still have good communication with her and can ask her a question of love.
And she works as a lawyer.
One of the Hardest Things for Me to Say
I can't say I've learned how to speak Czech well.
But I found a lot of new people in this process
I don't know if the flat on the fourth floor got rid of. We could see that people moved from there.
Can we move to our daughter's apartment in need of a separate room?
We can talk about next week.

Have a nice day. Thank you.

One million I'd deposit in several banks in different currencies so you could give me revenue.

Nicholas Michonowski first read independent Ukraine in 1990
It was an ordinary man fighting for Ukraine's independence.
Leonid Krakchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine
I think it was a dictatorship because people just got out of Russia and couldn't quite understand how they liked being an independent country or what they wanted to be an autonomous republic of Russia.
By the time Ukraine was independent, Kiev was already Kiev, but there was Kharkiv city from 1912 to 1934.
I can't say there were any other interesting things but if there was democracy at first it was much better and probably now we're in the European Union
